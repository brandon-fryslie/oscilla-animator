Scope: Track A: Transform Storage Unification
Completion: 80% (4/5 deliverables) | Gaps: A.4 needs unified function, A.5 blocked
Reused: N/A (fresh evaluation) | Fresh: Complete analysis of Track A progress
Cache updated: None (no reusable knowledge extracted)
Ambiguities: 0 found | Workflow: CONTINUE
NEW FINDING: Function signature incompatibility (LensApplyFn vs AdapterApplyFn) - not in original plan, but manageable
-> Complete A.4 (unified applyTransforms with kind branching), then A.5 (remove legacy fields)
