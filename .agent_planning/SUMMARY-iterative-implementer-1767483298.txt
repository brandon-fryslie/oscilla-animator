TASK: Add missing type exports to src/editor/types.ts

RESULT: Types were already added in previous commits. Verified resolution.

VERIFICATION:
- Before this session: 30+ "has no exported member" errors
- After verification: 0 "has no exported member" errors  
- Fixed: BusCombineMode → CombineMode rename in modulation-table/types.ts

TYPES CONFIRMED EXPORTED:
✓ Slot, SlotWorld, SlotTier, SlotType, DefaultSource
✓ BlockSubcategory, BlockCategory, ALL_SUBCATEGORIES
✓ KernelId, KernelCapability, Capability, PureCompileKind
✓ CombinePolicy (deprecated), ExposedParam
✓ TypeWorld, Domain (re-exports)
✓ createTypeDesc, isDirectlyCompatible (re-exports)
✓ SLOT_TYPE_TO_TYPE_DESC (stub)

INTENTIONALLY NOT ADDED (per user instructions):
✗ Publisher, Listener - removed in bus-block unification

NOTES:
- Main work done in commits 3e3b612 and 3a34cee
- Remaining TypeScript errors are unrelated to missing exports
- UIControlHint type definition doesn't match usage (separate issue)
