# User Response: Event System Phase C

**Date**: 2025-12-20-152000
**Status**: APPROVED (with naming tweak)

## User Feedback

User approved Phase C with naming clarification:
- Rename `ConnectionAdded/ConnectionRemoved` to `WireAdded/WireRemoved`
- Rationale: "Use Bus and Wire directly in the event names... being explicit is going to be a lot better long term"

## Approved Deliverables

1. **WireAdded/WireRemoved events** (renamed from ConnectionAdded/ConnectionRemoved)
   - Emit from PatchStore.connect()/disconnect()
   - Cascade deletion emits events for each wire

2. **PatchStore Decoupling**
   - Remove UIStore mutation from removeBlock()

## Naming Convention Established

| Domain | Event Names |
|--------|-------------|
| Bus connections (pub/sub) | BindingAdded, BindingRemoved |
| Wire connections (ports) | WireAdded, WireRemoved |
| Bus lifecycle | BusCreated, BusDeleted |
| Block lifecycle | BlockAdded, BlockRemoved |
