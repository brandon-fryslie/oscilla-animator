# User Response: Composite Library Sprint
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-20-034500
**Status:** APPROVED WITH REVISIONS

## User Feedback

The user revised the priority order:

1. **SVGSampleDomain primitive** - TOP PRIORITY. Was listed as "blocked" but user says this IS the top priority. Must implement the missing primitive first.

2. **Macro expansion system** - Must be completed fully in this sprint. Was listed as "deferred" but user wants it done.

3. **Legacy macro migration** - Can be deferred until deliverables 1-4 are complete. User trusts our judgment on this.

## Revised Priority Order

### P0 (Critical - Do First)
- SVGSampleDomain primitive implementation
- SVG Sample Points composite (unblocked by primitive)

### P1 (High - Do Second)
- Macro expansion system architecture and implementation
- Wire macro expansion into PatchStore.addBlock()

### P2 (Original P0-P1 items)
- Bus-Aware Composite Support
- 8 new composites (RotationScatter, BreathingScale, PaletteDrift, etc.)

### P3 (Quality)
- Test suite
- Documentation

### Deferred
- Legacy macro migration (until P0-P3 complete)

## Approved Files
