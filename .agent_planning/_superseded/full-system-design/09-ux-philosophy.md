# UX Philosophy

How phase, looping, and infinity feel to use. Not widgets—this is about interaction, intuition, and play.
This explains the emotional and cognitive loop Loom creates, and why phase + buses transform animation from a task into a practice.

## The Core UX Promise

From the user's point of view:

> "Nothing ever 'ends'.
> Things pulse, drift, return, and evolve — and I can lean into any of those behaviors."

The UX must make infinite time feel:
- safe
- musical
- exploratory
- never brittle

---

## The Core Experiential Shift

Traditional animation tools reward:
- planning
- precision
- completion

Loom rewards:
- listening
- tuning
- discovery
- staying with the system

The phase/looping system is what enables this shift.

---

## How Users Discover Looping (Without Being Told)

There is **no "Loop" button** that turns looping on.

Instead:
- users add a **phase source**
- publish it to a bus
- bind visual attributes to it
- observe repetition

Looping is **emergent**, not declared.

This mirrors music:
- there is no "enable groove"
- you add rhythm, and groove appears

---

## The Primary Mental Model Users Operate In

Users think in terms of:
- **"What is the rhythm here?"** → phase buses
- **"What responds to that rhythm?"** → bindings + interpretation stacks
- **"What evolves over time?"** → slow buses, integrators, regime switches

They do not think in:
- frames
- keyframes
- start/end points
- duration sliders (except when defining phase periods)

---

## Why Phase Feels Playable

Phase has three properties that make it intrinsically engaging:
1. **It always moves**
2. **It always returns**
3. **It never ends**

This mirrors:
- breathing
- tides
- rhythms
- music

When users bind visuals to phase:
- they stop waiting for "what happens next"
- they start feeling the cycle

This is why phase is the emotional entry point.

---

## Shared Influence Creates Coherence (And Pleasure)

When many things listen to the same phase bus:
- motion feels intentional
- changes feel connected
- visuals feel "composed"

But because interpretation differs:
- nothing looks identical
- repetition doesn't feel mechanical

This balance—coherence without uniformity—is deeply satisfying.

---

## Infinite Time Removes Performance Anxiety

In finite animations:
- users chase a perfect 5 seconds
- every tweak risks breaking the loop
- the end is always looming

In infinite systems:
- there is no "final take"
- adjustments are exploratory
- nothing is wasted

This lowers cognitive load and encourages experimentation.

---

## Slow Evolution Creates Emotional Depth

By introducing:
- slow phase buses
- integrators
- regime switches

The system develops:
- moods
- arcs
- tension and release

Users experience:
> "This feels different now... but I didn't tell it to change."

That sensation is magnetic.

---

## Immediate Feedback Keeps Users in Flow

Key UX loop:
1. User changes something
2. System responds immediately
3. Response is meaningful, not chaotic
4. User adjusts again

Phase + buses guarantee this because:
- nothing blocks evaluation
- nothing explodes combinatorially
- most changes are local in effect

Flow state emerges naturally.

---

## The Pleasure of Tuning, Not Programming

Users aren't writing logic.

They are:
- balancing forces
- shaping responses
- adjusting relationships

This feels closer to:
- mixing audio
- tuning an instrument
- gardening a system

The Bus Board is critical here—it makes influence tangible.

---

## Why This Feels Like a Music Visualizer (But Deeper)

Music visualizers feel good because:
- they react continuously
- structure is audible
- variation emerges from rhythm

Loom goes further by letting users:
- design the rhythms
- layer multiple time scales
- evolve the response logic

Users aren't watching a visualizer.
They are playing one.

---

## The "One More Tweak" Effect

Because:
- nothing ends
- nothing breaks
- everything responds

Users naturally think:
> "What if I just change this one thing..."

This is the hallmark of engaging creative systems.

---

## Why People Come Back

Users return because:
- systems they built feel alive
- they want to see how they evolve
- small changes yield new behaviors

The patch becomes a companion, not a file.

---

## The Ultimate Test

If the system is working, users will:
- let patches run unattended
- come back later
- feel like the system has grown

That is the emotional payoff of infinite animation.

---

## UX Around Phase Sources

### Adding a phase source feels like:
> "I'm adding a clock."

When a phase block is placed:
- its period is immediately visible
- its waveform/shape is previewed
- it offers one-click publishing to a new or existing phase bus

There is no ambiguity about:
- what repeats
- how fast
- how it lines up with other phases

---

## Binding to Phase: Clarity Over Cleverness

When a user binds a parameter to a phase bus:
1. The parameter moves immediately
2. The movement is usually boring at first (identity mapping)
3. A subtle affordance appears: "Change how this feels"

The system invites interpretation, not configuration.

---

## Interpretation Stacks as "Performance Feel"

Interpretation stacks are presented as:
- feel-shaping tools
- not technical adapters

Examples users recognize immediately:
- "ease in"
- "step through"
- "only sometimes"
- "slow it down"
- "react only at peaks"

This makes looping expressive instead of mechanical.

---

## Multi-Scale Time: How Users Sense It

Users don't think "micro/meso/macro".

They think:
- "this wiggles"
- "this drifts"
- "this changes mood every so often"

The UX reinforces this by:
- visually grouping buses by tempo
- showing slow buses with longer sparklines
- subtly color-coding time scales

This teaches rhythm by sight.

---

## Infinite Time Without Anxiety

A critical UX goal:

> Users must never feel like they are "missing something" because time is passing.

Therefore:
- scrubbing always works for derived phase systems
- stateful systems show clear indicators
- users can pause, inspect, rewind without penalty

Time is something you explore, not chase.

---

## Live Editing as Play, Not Surgery

While the system runs:
- users add blocks
- change bindings
- re-route influence
- adjust phase relationships

Nothing "breaks".
Nothing hard-resets unless explicitly requested.

This makes:
- exploration joyful
- complexity approachable
- mistakes harmless

---

## Performance Mode: The System Becomes an Instrument

In Performance Mode:
- phase buses feel like tempo faders
- energy feels like dynamics
- palette feels like harmony
- triggers feel like hits

The UX shifts from "editing" to "playing":
- larger controls
- fewer distractions
- emphasis on buses over blocks

This is where infinite animation becomes alive.
