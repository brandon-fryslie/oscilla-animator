Status: complete

Summary:
Fixed all 7 unused import warnings by removing unused type imports from:
1. src/editor/compiler/ir/stateLayout.ts - removed StateId
2. src/editor/compiler/passes/__tests__/pass5-scc.test.ts - removed BusIndex
3. src/editor/compiler/passes/pass3-time.ts - removed BlockIndex
4. src/editor/compiler/passes/pass4-depgraph.ts - removed BusIndex
5. src/editor/runtime/executor/steps/executeMaterialize.ts - removed SignalExprIR
6. src/editor/runtime/executor/steps/executeSignalEval.ts - removed SignalExprIR
7. src/editor/stores/PatchStore.ts - removed Publisher and Listener

All imports were genuinely unused - no runtime behavior was affected.
