Completion: N/A (no changes needed) | Gaps: 0 | Test Quality: N/A
Reused: 2 findings (multi-input-architecture, phase0-compat-cleanup) | Fresh: 1 finding
Cache updated: [1 file] bus-slot-combine-status.md
Ambiguities: 1 found (user intent unclear) | Workflow: PAUSE
Status: System already correctly unified at type level - no changes needed unless user clarifies different intent

Key Finding:
- Bus.combineMode and Slot.combine are INTENTIONALLY DIFFERENT by design
- Already unified at CombineMode type level (types.ts:125)
- Different wrappers serve different purposes (buses vs input slots)
- Unifying field names would lose type safety and violate design spec

Recommendation: PAUSE - clarify user intent before proceeding
