Completed: Remove deprecated CompilerConnection type usage | Files: 4 | Commits: 1
Cache invalidated: None (changes are minimal - removed unused parameter only)
Status: complete

Summary:
--------
Successfully completed Sprint 4 cleanup task to remove remaining deprecated types.

Changes Made:
1. Removed unused _wires parameter from pass8LinkResolution function (was already receiving empty array)
2. Updated caller in compileBusAware.ts (removed empty array and comment)
3. Updated all test calls (14 instances) to remove the wires argument
4. Removed CompilerConnection from compiler/index.ts exports
5. Type definition remains in types.ts with @deprecated marker (for reference)

Validation:
- just typecheck: PASS
- just test: PASS (2428 passed)
- All connections now use Edge type exclusively

Impact:
- Simpler function signature (3 params instead of 4)
- CompilerConnection no longer exported but still defined (deprecated)
- CompositeConnection kept (different purpose - for composite definitions)

Files Modified:
- src/editor/compiler/passes/pass8-link-resolution.ts
- src/editor/compiler/compileBusAware.ts
- src/editor/compiler/index.ts
