# User Response: Renderer IR Master Plan
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-26-160000
**Response:** APPROVED

## Approved Plan Scope

The user approved the **entire Master Plan** for the Renderer IR System, covering all 8 phases:

| Phase | Name | Sprints | Status |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| A | IR Type Definitions | 2 | Ready to start |
| B | Color & Encoding Foundation | 1 | Queued |
| C | Instances2D Runtime | 2 | Queued |
| D | Paths2D Runtime | 2 | Queued |
| E | Caching Infrastructure | 2-3 | Queued |
| F | Canvas Renderer Rewrite | 1 | Queued |
| G | 3D Camera & Mesh | 2 | Queued |
| H | 3D Projection Pipeline | 2-3 | Queued |

**Total Estimated:** 14-16 sprints

## Approved Files

The following planning files constitute the approved plan:

1. `MASTER-PLAN-2025-12-26-154607.md` - Complete 8-phase master plan
2. `PLAN-PHASE-A-2025-12-26-154607.md` - Detailed Phase A sprint plan
3. `DOD-PHASE-A-2025-12-26-154607.md` - Phase A acceptance criteria
4. `STATUS-20251226160000.md` - Initial evaluation status

## Design Document Coverage

100% traceability achieved across all 8 design documents:
- `00-Overview-n-Context.md` → Phases A, C, D
- `01-RendererIR.md` → Phases A, C, D (ALL IR types)
- `03-Decisions-Color-PathFlattening-Basic3d.md` → Phases B, D, G
- `04-Decision-to-IR.md` → Phases B, D
- `05-Decisions-Upstream-Impacts.md` → Phases B, E
- `06-3d-Again.md` → (empty, superseded)
- `07-3d-Canonical.md` → Phases G, H
- `08-Caching-Spec.md` → Phase E (complete caching spec)

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase A implementation (IR Type Definitions)
2. Generate detailed plans for Phases B-H as each phase approaches
3. Run `/lp:impl` when ready to start Phase A implementation

## Approval Context

- **User Selection:** "Approve entire Master Plan"
- **Meaning:** Accept all 8 phases (A-H). Detailed plans will be created for each phase as we progress.
