# User Response: Phase 7 Debug Infrastructure Integration

**Date**: 2025-12-25-233000
**Decision**: APPROVED (auto-approved per CLAUDE.md low-risk policy)

## Approved Plan Files
- PLAN-2025-12-25-232750.md
- DOD-2025-12-25-232750.md

## Rationale for Auto-Approval
- Low risk: All core functionality already works (121 tests passing)
- Clear criteria: Well-defined acceptance criteria for each deliverable
- Minimal scope: 2-3 deliverables focused on wiring, not new functionality
- No breaking changes: All new fields are optional

## Sprint Scope Confirmed
1. Export debug modules from index.ts
2. DebugIndex creation/population in Passes 1, 6, 7, 8
3. TypeKeyTable creation in Pass 2
4. RuntimeCtx extension with frameId/tMs
5. Player populates RuntimeCtx during render

## Deferred Items Acknowledged
- Closure wrapping (Phase 8)
- SpanRing/ValueRing instantiation (Phase 8)
- Debug UI consumption (Phase 8)
- EdgeRing for causal links (future)
- Performance optimization (future)
