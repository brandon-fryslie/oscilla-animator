Key Finding: The VITE_USE_UNIFIED_COMPILER feature flag was completely removed
from the codebase on 2025-12-28 (commit 87833ab). The unified compiler is now
mandatory - there is no toggle mechanism. The original parsing bug (lines 113-115
forcing useUnifiedCompiler=true when env var exists) no longer exists because
the entire feature was removed.

Stale Artifacts: Planning documents in .agent_planning/_active/compiler-audit-redflag/
still reference the removed feature and should be updated to reflect reality.

Test Coverage Gap: No tests exist for initializeFeatureFlags() environment variable
parsing. Remaining flags (VITE_STRICT_STATE_VALIDATION, VITE_TIMECTX_PROPAGATION)
use correct parsing pattern but lack test coverage.
