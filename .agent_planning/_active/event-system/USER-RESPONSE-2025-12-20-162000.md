# User Response: Event System Phase D

**Date**: 2025-12-20-162000
**Status**: APPROVED (with roadmap updates)

## User Feedback

User approved Phase D with roadmap modifications:
- "Do not defer logging events"
- "Do not defer selection events"
- "Once you're done implementing this plan, please plan the work for a Diagnostic Events system"

## Approved Deliverables (Phase D)

1. BlockReplaced event definition + emission
2. RootStore listener updates selection on replace
3. Remove direct UIStore mutation from PatchStore.replaceBlock()

## Updated Remaining Roadmap

**HIGH VALUE (implement next):**
- BlockParamsUpdated (undo/redo for params)
- TimeRootChanged (runtime/player coordination)
- Logging events (NOT deferred - convert compiler logging)
- Selection events (NOT deferred - emit on selection changes)

**MEDIUM VALUE:**
- PlaybackStarted/PlaybackStopped (telemetry)
- CompileStarted (loading states)

**NEXT PLANNING:**
- Diagnostic Events system (plan after Phase D complete)
