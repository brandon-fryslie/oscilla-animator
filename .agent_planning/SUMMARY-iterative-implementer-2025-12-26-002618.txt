Completed: Sprint 4 transform chains | Files: 6 | Commits: 2
Tests: 108 passing, 0 failing
Cache invalidated: none (no existing signalexpr cache entries)
Status: complete

Summary:
Implemented SignalExpr transform chain execution (Sprint 4) with full test coverage.

Work Completed:
1. Created EasingCurves.ts with 7 built-in curves (linear, easeIn/Out/InOut quad/cubic, smoothstep)
2. Extended SigEnv with transformTable and easingCurves fields
3. Implemented evalTransform() with pipeline-based step application
4. Implemented applyTransformStep() for all step kinds:
   - scaleBias: y = mx + b (linear transform)
   - normalize: clamp to 0..1 or -1..1
   - quantize: round to nearest step
   - ease: apply easing curve (input clamped to [0,1])
   - map: apply pure function (reuses OpCode)
   - slew: PLACEHOLDER - throws "StateBuffer not implemented" error
5. Extended DebugSink with TransformTraceInfo for step-by-step tracing
6. Added 31 comprehensive tests covering all step kinds, chains, error cases, and debug tracing
7. Updated index.ts with new exports

Test Results:
- All 108 tests pass (77 existing + 31 new transform tests)
- Transform tests cover:
  - Empty chains (no-op)
  - All 5 pure step kinds (scaleBias, normalize, quantize, ease, map)
  - Slew placeholder error
  - Multi-step chains with pipeline semantics
  - Caching behavior
  - Debug tracing
  - Error handling (invalid chain ID, invalid curve ID)
