Scope: project/block-compiler-migration
Completion: 0% | Gaps: 36 blocks to migrate | Test Quality: 1/5 (minimal coverage)
Reused: 1 STALE finding (compiler-architecture.md) | Fresh: All findings in this eval
Cache updated: None (eval-cache adequate)
Ambiguities: 2 found (Dual-emit strategy, Domain IR representation)
Workflow: CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- 36 block compilers emit closures, target is IR via BlockLowerFn
- MISSING TYPES: BlockLowerFn, LowerCtx, LowerResult, BlockDeclarations NOT implemented
- Pass 6 creates placeholder IR from closure artifacts, not real block lowering
- SignalExprBuilder exists as lightweight migration helper (Sprint 7)
- Full IRBuilder interface exists but unused by block compilers

Complexity Tiers:
- Tier 1 (Pure Math): 7 blocks, LOW effort, no dependencies
- Tier 2 (Parameterized): 5 blocks, MEDIUM effort
- Tier 3-4 (Field): 15 blocks, MEDIUM-HIGH effort, Domain dependency
- Tier 5-6 (Domain/Position): 6 blocks, HIGH effort
- Tier 7-8 (Time/Stateful): 5 blocks, HIGH effort
- Tier 9-10 (Render/Special): 4 blocks, VERY HIGH effort

Parallel Workstreams:
- A: Signal blocks (13 blocks) - can start immediately
- B: Field infrastructure - blocked on LowerCtx types
- C: Domain chain - blocked on Domain IR representation
- D: Time blocks - blocked on TimeModelIR
- E: Stateful + Render - blocked on all above

-> Priority 1: Create missing types (lowerTypes.ts)
-> Priority 2: Migrate AddSignal as proof of concept
-> Priority 3: Clarify Domain IR representation before field migration
