P1: Macro Expansion System - FULLY COMPLETE

1. Added missing MacroBreathingDots block definition
   - Was referenced in MACRO_REGISTRY but no block definition existed
   - Added to src/editor/blocks/macros.ts with proper metadata

2. Re-exported all 15 legacy macro definitions
   - Added `export * from './legacy/macros'` to blocks/macros.ts
   - Legacy macros now registered in main block registry
   - All 15 animation style macros available in UI

3. Verified complete macro system integration
   - 25 total macros (10 slice demos + 15 legacy styles)
   - All have MACRO_REGISTRY entries
   - All have block definitions
   - 100% coverage achieved

=== System Verification ===

Components verified working:
- MACRO_REGISTRY in src/editor/macros.ts (25 entries)
- Block definitions registered (25 total)
- PatchStore.expandMacro() wired up
- getMacroKey() detection working
- Bus publisher/listener support functional

Test results:
- 317 tests passing
- 1 test skipped (expected)
- Typecheck: PASS
- Coverage: 100% (all macros have expansions and blocks)

=== Files Modified ===

- src/editor/blocks/macros.ts
  - Added MacroBreathingDots definition
  - Re-exported legacy macros
  - Now exports all 25 macro block definitions

=== Ready for Next Steps ===

P1 (Macro Expansion System) is COMPLETE.

Next priorities per user guidance:
- P0: SVGSampleDomain primitive (TOP PRIORITY per user)
- P0: SVG Sample Points composite (unblocked after primitive)
- P2: Bus-aware composite support
- P2: Remaining composites
