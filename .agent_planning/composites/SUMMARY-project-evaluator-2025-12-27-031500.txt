Scope: composites/full
Completion: 85% | Gaps: 1 major (custom UI) | Test Quality: 4/5

Cache updated: None (first evaluation of this topic)
Ambiguities: 3 found | Workflow: CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- 23 composites implemented (exceeds spec of 17)
- 40/40 tests passing
- IR compiler integration complete
- BlockLibrary.tsx has composites disabled (line 11-12: TODO comment, hardcoded empty array)
- No UI for creating custom composites
- CompositeStore exists but has no persistence

Immediate Fix Available:
- Uncomment line 11-12 in BlockLibrary.tsx to show all 23 composites in palette

Files Examined: 15
Primitives in Composites: 15 unique primitive types used
Tests Run: composite-library.test.ts (40 tests, all pass)
