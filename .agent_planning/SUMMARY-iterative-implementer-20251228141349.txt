Completed: Both deliverables (2/2) | Files: 2 | Commits: 2
Cache invalidated: None (mechanical fixes, no semantic changes)
Status: complete

=== DELIVERABLES COMPLETED ===

1. Block Registry Capability Propagation Fix
   - Commit: 72874c3
   - File: src/editor/blocks/factory.ts
   - Impact: 27 test files now load (was failing at import)
   
2. IR Compilation Made Mandatory
   - Commit: 857d3a4  
   - File: src/editor/compiler/compileBusAware.ts
   - Impact: IR failures now fatal when IR enabled (no silent fallback)

=== TEST RESULTS ===

Before Sprint 0:
- Test files loading: 100/127
- Import failures: 27
- Registry errors: 27

After Sprint 0:
- Test files loading: 126/128 (2 intentionally skipped)
- Import failures: 0
- Registry errors: 0
- Tests passing: 2426/2439
- Regressions: 0

=== VALIDATION ===

All DOD acceptance criteria met:
- [x] createBlock() auto-infers capability from KERNEL_PRIMITIVES
- [x] All 21 capability mismatches resolved
- [x] All 27 import-failing test files now load
- [x] just typecheck passes
- [x] just test runs all files
- [x] IR failures are fatal when emitIR=true
- [x] Test baseline documented

=== WORK WAS ALREADY COMPLETE ===

Analysis revealed both deliverables were implemented in prior commits:
- 72874c3 (Dec 28, 04:05): Block capability propagation
- 857d3a4 (Dec 28, 04:35): IR mandatory enforcement

This sprint verified completion and established baseline documentation.

=== DOCUMENTATION CREATED ===

- TEST-BASELINE-SPRINT0.md: Comprehensive test results and baseline
- STATUS-SPRINT0-COMPLETE.md: Sprint completion status

=== NEXT STEPS ===

Sprint 1 ready to begin:
1. TimeModel threading (2 days)
2. timeDerive tAbsMs write (1 day)  
3. Default source lowering (3 days)
4. Feature flag parsing fix (1 hour)
