Completed: Fixed TypeScript errors in bus-compilation.test.ts and field-bus-compilation.test.ts | Files: 2 | Commits: 0
Tests: N/A (cannot run due to unrelated TS errors in codebase)
Cache invalidated: None (test files only, no cache invalidation needed)
Status: complete

Summary:
- Replaced all 16 occurrences of `defaultSources: []` with `defaultSources: {}` across both test files
- 8 occurrences fixed in bus-compilation.test.ts (lines 183, 224, 272, 320, 373, 419, 444, 489)
- 8 occurrences fixed in field-bus-compilation.test.ts (lines 247, 299, 348, 388, 435, 484, 533, 614)
- The defaultSources field expects a Record<string, DefaultSourceState> type, not an array
- TypeScript errors in these specific test files are now resolved
- Other unrelated TypeScript errors in the codebase prevent test execution
