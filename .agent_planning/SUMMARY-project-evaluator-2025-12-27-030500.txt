Scope: module/event-diagnostics
Completion: 75% | Gaps: 3 major | Test Quality: 4/5
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: 15 findings
Cache updated: N/A (no reusable patterns to cache)
Ambiguities: 0 found | Workflow: CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- Event types (17), EventDispatcher, DiagnosticHub, DiagnosticStore, ActionExecutor: COMPLETE
- DiagnosticsConsole UI: COMPLETE but NOT INTEGRATED into main layout
- GraphCommitted, ProgramSwapped, RuntimeHealthSnapshot: EMITTED correctly
- CompileStarted/CompileFinished: EMISSION NOT VERIFIED (compiler integration missing)
- Inline badges on blocks/buses: NOT STARTED
- All 130 diagnostic tests PASS

Sprint Deliverables (3):
1. Wire DiagnosticsConsole into EditorLayout (LOW complexity)
2. Add CompileFinished event emission from compiler (MEDIUM complexity)
3. Add inline DiagnosticBadge on blocks (MEDIUM complexity)

-> Wire DiagnosticsConsole into UI first to verify data flow works
