Completed: Fixed TypeScript errors in PreviewPanel.tsx | Files: 1 | Commits: 0
Cache invalidated: None (no eval cache exists yet)
Status: complete

Changes Made:
- Fixed all occurrences of `result.compiledIR` to `result.programIR` in PreviewPanel.tsx
- Changed lines 195, 200, 211, 212, 214 to use the correct property name
- TypeScript errors in PreviewPanel.tsx are now resolved

The property name was incorrect according to the CompileResult interface in types.ts:
- WRONG: result.compiledIR
- CORRECT: result.programIR (which is of type CompiledProgramIR with a timeModel property)
