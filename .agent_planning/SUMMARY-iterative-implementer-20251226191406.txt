## Summary

Fixed all TypeScript errors in test files by adding missing `deps: []` property to all step objects and updating StepRenderAssemble field names.

## Changes Made

1. **executeBusEval.test.ts** - Added `deps: []` to all StepBusEval objects (10 instances)
2. **executeMaterialize.test.ts** - Added `deps: []` to StepMaterialize object (1 instance)
3. **executeRenderAssemble.test.ts** - Added `deps: []` and updated field names:
   - Changed `rootNodeIndex` → `instance2dListSlot`
   - Changed `outSlot` → `outFrameSlot`
   - Added `pathBatchListSlot`
4. **RuntimeState.test.ts** - Added `deps: []` to all step objects (9 instances)
5. **ScheduleExecutor.swapProgram.test.ts** - Added `deps: []` to all step objects (3 instances)
6. **ScheduleExecutor.test.ts** - Added `deps: []` to all step objects and updated StepRenderAssemble (7 instances)
7. **stepDispatch.test.ts** - Added `deps: []` to all step objects and updated StepRenderAssemble (7 instances)

## Verification

Ran `pnpm typecheck` to verify all test file errors were resolved:
- Before: 43 TypeScript errors across 7 test files
- After: 0 TypeScript errors in test files

Remaining errors are in `src/editor/runtime/executor/steps/executeRenderAssemble.ts` (not a test file, not in scope).
