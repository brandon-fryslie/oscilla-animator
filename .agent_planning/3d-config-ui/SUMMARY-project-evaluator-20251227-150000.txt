Completion: 40% | Gaps: 6 major | Test Quality: N/A (UI evaluation)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: 15 findings
Cache updated: None (scoped evaluation)
Ambiguities: 5 found | Workflow: CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- 3D runtime infrastructure is COMPLETE (CameraStore, MeshStore, executors)
- Camera block definition: NOT STARTED (blocking)
- Mesh block definition: NOT STARTED (blocking)
- RenderInstances3D block: NOT STARTED (blocking)
- Vec3 UI control: NOT STARTED (blocking, easy to add)
- Quaternion UI control: NOT STARTED (not blocking, can use lookAt)
- Existing UI patterns are clear and reusable

-> Next: Create Vec3Editor control, then Camera block definition
