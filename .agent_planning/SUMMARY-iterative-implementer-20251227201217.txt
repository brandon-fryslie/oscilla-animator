Completed: Fixed TypeScript errors in integration.test.ts | Files: 1 | Commits: 0
Tests: N/A (manual mode, other files have pre-existing TS errors preventing test run)
Cache invalidated: None (no cache exists for this file)
Status: complete

SUMMARY:
Fixed TypeScript errors in /Users/bmf/code/oscilla-animator_codex/src/editor/transactions/__tests__/integration.test.ts

Changes Made:
1. Line 27: Changed SlotType from "signal:number" to "Signal<number>" and added direction: 'input'
2. Line 28: Changed SlotType from "signal:number" to "Signal<number>" and added direction: 'output'

The Slot interface requires both a 'type' property (SlotType) and a 'direction' property.
The correct SlotType format is "Signal<number>" not "signal:number".

Verification:
- TypeScript typecheck confirmed no errors in integration.test.ts
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in other files prevent full test run, but they are unrelated to this fix

File Modified:
