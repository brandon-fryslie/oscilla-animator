Scope: render-pipeline (6 gaps: z-order, curves, clipping, transforms, postfx, materials)
Completion: 90% (5.5/6 gaps functional) | Critical Issues: 1 (ClipGroup stubbed)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: 6 gap evaluations
Cache updated: render-pipeline-status.md in eval-cache/
Ambiguities: 3 found | Workflow: PAUSE

Gaps Status:
  ✅ Gap 1 (Z-Order): COMPLETE - functional
  ✅ Gap 2 (Curve Flattening): COMPLETE - De Casteljau algorithm implemented
  ⚠️ Gap 3 (Clipping): PARTIAL - types complete, ClipGroup rendering stubbed (logs warning)
  ✅ Gap 4 (Transforms): COMPLETE - rotation + scaleXY functional
  ⚠️ Gap 5 (PostFX): PARTIAL - 3/4 effects (blur, bloom, vignette), ColorGrade stubbed
  ✅ Gap 6 (Gradients): COMPLETE - linear/radial gradients functional

Critical Findings:
  1. ClipGroup passes do not render children (canvasRenderer.ts:253-255 logs warning)
  2. ColorGrade effect stubbed (renderPostFX.ts:180-188 logs warning)
  3. No persistent tests exist for any render features (validation by code inspection only)
  4. Type errors in state-offset-resolution.test.ts block test execution

Ambiguities Requiring Clarification:
  1. What does "COMPLETE" mean for stubbed features? (ClipGroup, ColorGrade)
     - Options: (A) Full impl required, (B) Stubs acceptable, (C) New "STUBBED" status
  2. Is runtime verification required for "COMPLETE"?
     - Options: (A) Tests/manual verify required, (B) Code inspection sufficient, (C) Automated tests only
  3. Should type errors be fixed before declaring render pipeline complete?
     - Options: (A) Fix first, (B) Track separately, (C) Block pipeline until fixed

Next Action: User should answer 3 clarification questions OR choose to CONTINUE accepting ambiguities.
