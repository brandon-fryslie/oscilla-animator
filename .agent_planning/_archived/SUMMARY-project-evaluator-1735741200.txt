Scope: Bus-Block Unification - Sprints 3 & 4 Analysis
Completion: Sprint 1 ✅ 100% | Sprint 2 ✅ 100% | Sprint 3 🟡 30% | Sprint 4 ❌ 0%
Gaps: 15 `kind === 'bus'` checks | Type cleanup not started | BusStore facade only
Reused: Sprint 1/2 plans and DOD files | Fresh: Complete inventory and Sprint 4 analysis
Cache updated: None (evaluation-specific, no reusable knowledge)
Ambiguities: None - requirements clear from sprint plans
Workflow: CONTINUE with Sprint 3, but FIX TESTS FIRST (43 failing)
-> Immediate action: Fix 43 failing tests before starting Sprint 3 type cleanup
