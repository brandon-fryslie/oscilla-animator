Tests: 2425 passing, 10 skipped
Cache invalidated: none (no cached default source evaluations)
Status: complete

Sprint 18 Final Deliverables:
1. Cycle detection (validateNoCycles):
   - Detects when provider reads from bus X and target publishes to bus X
   - Emits W_FEEDBACK_CYCLE warning (not error, may be intentional)
   - Friendly error messages with block/bus names

2. Edge case validations (validateEdgeCases):
   - Provider output port exists
   - All editableInputs exist in provider definition
   - All editableInputs have defaultSource metadata
   - Provider has no unsatisfiable required inputs

3. Diagnostic code registration:
   - Added W_FEEDBACK_CYCLE to diagnostic type system

All typecheck and tests passing. Linting clean for modified files.
Feature complete and ready for manual verification.
