# Canonical Adapters & Lenses System - ARCHIVED

**Original Location:** `/canonical-adapters-lenses/`
**Date Moved:** 2025-12-21
**Reasoning:** User declined this approach

## Why Archived

This plan from 2025-12-21 for a canonical adapters & lenses system was not started and appears to have been declined by the user in favor of other approaches.

The existing lens system (505 lines in `src/editor/lenses.ts`) already provides comprehensive adapter/lens functionality, making this canonical system approach unnecessary.

Key indicators:
- No STATUS file created (never started)
- User explicitly mentioned this was declined
- Existing implementation already covers most requirements
