Scope: architecture/bus-block-unification
Completion: 60% aligned | 0% implemented | Gaps: 5 ambiguities
Reused: 3 RECENT findings from eval-cache
Cache updated: None (specialized evaluation, not general knowledge)
Ambiguities: 5 found (bus metadata, compiler impl, UX, migration, diagnostics)
Workflow: PAUSE - Design questions need answers before implementation

Key Findings:
- Combine semantics ALREADY unified (Bus.combine = Slot.combine = CombinePolicy)
- createCombineNode() shared between Pass 6 and Pass 7
- Hidden block pattern exists (default-sources precedent)
- Would eliminate ~600 lines (Endpoint union, Publisher/Listener, Pass 7)
- Would unify edge handling (all port→port, no discriminated union)

Critical Blockers:
1. 5 design ambiguities need resolution
2. Hidden block precedent not yet implemented (default-sources)
3. Migration strategy unclear (risk to existing patches)

Next Action: Answer 5 ambiguities (#1-5 in STATUS), then implement default-sources hidden blocks first
