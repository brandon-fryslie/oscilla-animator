Completion: ISSUE IDENTIFIED | Gaps: 1 missing observable | Test Quality: N/A
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: 1 architecture discovery
Cache updated: [compilation-triggers.md, INDEX.md]
Ambiguities: 0 found | Workflow: CONTINUE

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- DefaultSourceStore.sources NOT tracked in setupAutoCompile reaction
- Changing default values updates store but doesn't trigger recompilation
- Workaround: Change any connection to force recompile
- Fix: Add defaultSourceStore.sources to MobX reaction in integration.ts:1094-1107

RECOMMENDATION:
Add default source tracking to setupAutoCompile reaction (Option 1 in evaluation).
Minimal, surgical fix. Low risk. Immediately resolves user-reported issue.
