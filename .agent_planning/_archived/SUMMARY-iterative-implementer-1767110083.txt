Completed: Bundle split/merge operations | Files: 5 | Commits: 1 (bac2361)
Tests: 2487 passing (18 new for bundle operations)
Cache invalidated: runtime-bundle-types.md (IR operations added)
Status: complete - Sprint 2 gaps partially filled

Implementation Summary:
- Added SignalExprBundleSplit IR node for extracting bundle components
- Added SignalExprBundleMerge IR node for constructing bundles from scalars
- Implemented IRBuilder.sigBundleSplit() - returns array of component signals
- Implemented IRBuilder.sigBundleMerge() - validates arity, constructs bundle
- Created 18 comprehensive tests covering all bundle kinds (Scalar through Mat4)

What Works:
- Split any bundle kind into N scalar signals (N = arity)
- Merge N scalar signals into any bundle kind
- Arity validation (throws error on mismatch)
- Round-trip: split → modify components → merge
- Mix components from different bundles

Remaining Sprint 2 Gaps (from evaluation):
1. Port type distinction (PortScalar vs PortBundle) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
2. Port mismatch validation (compile error) - NOT IMPLEMENTED

These require:
- Extending Slot type in src/editor/types.ts with bundle metadata
- Adding port connection validation in compiler passes
- Wire validation during connection resolution

Next Steps:
The bundle operations foundation is complete and tested. Port validation
is a separate concern that touches the editor's type system and connection
logic, not just the IR layer. This should be tackled as a separate task.
