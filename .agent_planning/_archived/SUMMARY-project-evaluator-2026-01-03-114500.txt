Ambiguities: 4 critical questions need answers
Workflow: PAUSE - Ambiguities block implementation

Key Findings:
- Target: RawGraph → NormalizedGraph separation (spec §16)
- Current: Ad-hoc normalization in compiler (pass0-materialize.ts)
- MISSING: RawGraph/NormalizedGraph types, GraphNormalizer module, anchor-based IDs
- MISSING: Role metadata on edges, wire-state blocks, incremental normalization
- PARTIAL: Default sources materialized as blocks (✅) but in compiler (❌)
- PARTIAL: BusBlock unification complete (✅) but no anchor IDs (❌)

Blockers (PAUSE reasons):
1. Eager vs lazy normalization strategy - architecture decision needed
2. Wire-state block semantics - spec unclear, can't implement undefined feature
3. Hash algorithm for anchor IDs - spec says "hash" but doesn't specify which
4. BusBlock classification - user-created vs structural (affects anchor system)

Next Action:
→ User/researcher must resolve 4 ambiguities in EVALUATION-2026-01-03.md §Ambiguities
→ After resolution: define types (RawGraph, Anchor), create module structure
→ Estimated effort: 5-7 days (large architectural refactor)
