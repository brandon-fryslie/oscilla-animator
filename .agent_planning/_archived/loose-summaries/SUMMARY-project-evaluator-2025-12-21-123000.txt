Scope: ui-refactor-prep/time-authority (Issue #2)
Completion: 85% | Gaps: 2 critical | Test Quality: N/A (no new tests needed)
Reused: 2 docs (3-Time.md, 3.5-PhaseClock-Fix.md, time-authority/DOD)
Fresh: 1 full code review + 1 spec cross-check
Cache updated: [time-architecture.md, INDEX.md] in eval-cache/
Ambiguities: 1 found (when to flip requireTimeRoot flag - ANSWERED)
Workflow: CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- Player time monotonic for cyclic/infinite (CORRECT - commit 1857bb8)
- TimeRoot compilers mathematically correct (VERIFIED)
- requireTimeRoot flag OFF - needs flip to TRUE (BLOCKER #1)
- Legacy PhaseClock/PhaseMachine inference still active (BLOCKER #2)
- All core mechanics proven sound, gaps are configuration/cleanup

Next Action:
  Implementer should:
  1. Flip requireTimeRoot flag to true (featureFlags.ts:52)
  2. Remove legacy inference fallbacks (compileBusAware.ts:782-804)
  3. Add auto-insert default TimeRoot on patch creation
  Estimated: 1-2 hours work, low risk
