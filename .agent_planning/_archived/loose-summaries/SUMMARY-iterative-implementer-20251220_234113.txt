Completed: ActionExecutor service for diagnostics Phase D | Files: 4 | Commits: 1
Tests: 19 passing (ActionExecutor-specific), 729 total passing
Cache invalidated: None (no eval cache modifications needed)
Status: complete

Implementation Summary:
- Created ActionExecutor.ts service with execute() method handling all 7 diagnostic action kinds
- goToTarget: Selects blocks, buses, or other entities based on target.kind
- insertBlock: Adds blocks to appropriate lanes with optional positioning
- removeBlock: Removes blocks with validation
- createTimeRoot: Creates TimeRoot blocks, removes existing ones, auto-publishes to buses
- muteDiagnostic: Delegates to DiagnosticHub.muteDiagnostic()
- openDocs: Opens documentation URLs in new tab
- addAdapter: Deferred to Phase 3 (returns false with warning)
- Integrated ActionExecutor into RootStore as actionExecutor property
- Updated DiagnosticsConsole to use ActionExecutor for handleGoToTarget callback
- Created comprehensive unit tests (19 tests) covering all action types and error handling
- All tests passing, typecheck passing, lint passing (warnings pre-existing)

Next Steps:
- Future enhancement: Scroll to view and flash highlight for goToTarget actions
- Future enhancement: Multi-select support for graphSpan targets
- Phase 3: Implement addAdapter action with connection rewiring logic
