Workflow: PAUSE - Critical UI integration bug must be fixed before proceeding

Key Finding: Feature is FULLY IMPLEMENTED but 100% NON-FUNCTIONAL due to BlockContextMenu not being rendered at top level in Editor.tsx.

Fix required: Single line addition to Editor.tsx (import + render BlockContextMenu component).

Next step: Fix rendering bug, perform manual browser test, then add unit test coverage.
