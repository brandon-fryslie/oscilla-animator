  → WP1 TimeRoot Compilers implementation complete with all P0 and P1 features. 3 existing tests failing expectedly due to new outputs added to TimeRoot blocks.

Key accomplishments:
- TimeOutputs bundle interface for standardized TimeRoot outputs
- Event type added to Artifact system for wrap/end events
- Missing TimeRoot outputs implemented (wrap, end, energy, cycleT, cycleIndex)
- Auto-publication mechanism from TimeRoot to canonical buses (phaseA, pulse, energy)
- WP0 reserved bus validation gates for type safety
- Comprehensive WP1 test suite with 13 passing tests
- Auto-publications with sortKey=0 for highest priority

Implementation follows the DoD specification and provides foundation for WP2 bus-aware compiler.
