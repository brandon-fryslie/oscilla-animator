Tests: 22 passing (ActionExecutor test suite)

Status: complete

Implementation Summary:
- Implemented addAdapter action in ActionExecutor that inserts adapter/lens blocks between connected ports
- Method finds existing connection, inserts adapter block, and rewires connections through adapter
- Includes comprehensive error handling with automatic rollback on failure
- Added 4 comprehensive unit tests covering success and failure scenarios
- All tests pass, typecheck passes, lint warnings pre-existing

Files Modified:
- src/editor/diagnostics/ActionExecutor.ts (added addAdapter method)
- src/editor/diagnostics/__tests__/ActionExecutor.test.ts (added test cases)

Technical Details:
- Adapter insertion follows pattern: source -> adapter -> destination
- Automatic port detection for 'in'/'input' and 'out'/'output' ports
- Rollback mechanism restores original connection if adapter ports invalid
- Selects inserted adapter for immediate user configuration
