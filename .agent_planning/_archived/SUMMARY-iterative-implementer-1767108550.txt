Completed: Pass 8 adapter/lens integration | Files: 1 | Commits: 1
Tests: 2425 passing, 0 failing
Cache invalidated: [] (cache was empty)
Status: complete

Work Completed:
- Modified src/editor/compiler/passes/pass8-link-resolution.ts
- Added applyAdapterChain() function to apply adapter transformations via compileToIR
- Added applyLensStack() function to apply lens transformations via compileToIR
- Replaced blanket rejection of adapters/lenses with conditional compilation
- Only errors when adapter/lens lacks compileToIR support
- Provides clear error messages with migration guidance

Validation:
- All 2425 tests passing
- just check passes (0 errors, 53 warnings - pre-existing)
- Wire with ConstToSignal adapter now compiles in IR mode
- Wire with scale/clamp lenses now compile in IR mode
- Unsupported adapters/lenses error clearly with helpful messages

Next Steps:
- Implement compileToIR for more adapters (BroadcastSignalToField, domain adapters)
- Implement compileToIR for more lenses (polarity, deadzone, quantize)
- Support non-literal lens param bindings (bus, wire, default)
