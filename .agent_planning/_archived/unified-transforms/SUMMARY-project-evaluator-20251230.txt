Scope: unified-transforms/full-project
Build Status: PASSING (just check succeeds, lint warnings only)
Readiness: READY to begin Phase 1 immediately

Current State:
- Adapters: FRAGMENTED (registry metadata only, execution in 250-line switch)
- Lenses: SCOPE MISMATCH (registry 'pub|list' but wires use lenses too)
- IR Compiler: INCONSISTENT (rejects adapters, silently ignores lenses)
- UI Components: MISSING from main branch (found in .worktrees only)
- Transform Storage: ALREADY UNIFIED in types (Connection/Publisher/Listener)

What Needs Building (6 Phases):
Phase 0: SKIP (build already stable)
Phase 1: Create transforms/ facade (5 new files, no behavior change)
Phase 2: Move adapter execution to registry (remove 112-line switch)
Phase 3: Expand LensScope to include wire+lensParam (27 lens defs)
Phase 4: Centralize transform application (one engine everywhere)
Phase 5: BLOCKED - UI components not found in main branch
Phase 6: IR consistency (Option A: implement, Option B: reject explicitly)

Recommended Sprint Breakdown:
Sprint 1 (3-5d): Phases 0.5+1+2 - Foundation + adapter unification
Sprint 2 (4-6d): Phases 3+4 - Lens scope + centralized application
Sprint 3 (5-7d): Phases 5+6 - UI (if found) + IR consistency
Sprint 4 (4-6d): Phase 9 - Semantic registry + full IR transforms (optional)

Total Estimate: 3-4 sprints for complete implementation

Critical Risks:
- HIGH: Phase 2 (adapter switch removal) - needs comprehensive testing
- MEDIUM: Phase 4 (refactor working compiler) - incremental migration
- UNKNOWN: Phase 5 (UI refactor) - components not located

Open Questions for User:
1. Where are lens UI components? (LensSelector/LensChainEditor not in main)
2. IR transforms: Option A (implement) or B (reject explicitly)?
3. Wire lens scope: Allow all pub+list lenses or restrict?
4. When to build semantic registry (phase lenses)?

Next Action: Create src/editor/transforms/ directory and implement Phase 1
