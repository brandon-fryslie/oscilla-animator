Completed: SignalExpr Runtime (Sprint 1 - Core Evaluator) | Files: 7 | Commits: 1
Tests: 33 passing, 0 failing
Cache invalidated: None needed (new module, no overlapping cache)
Status: complete

Implementation Summary:
- Created core SignalExpr evaluator with cache-first algorithm
- Implemented SigFrameCache with stamp-based invalidation (O(1) frame advance)
- Created SigEnv evaluation environment with const pool support
- Implemented OpCodeRegistry for pure function execution
- Added support for const, timeAbsMs, map, and zip nodes
- 33 passing tests covering all functionality
- Full README documentation with usage examples

All acceptance criteria from DOD met (P0, P1, P2).
All quality gates pass (tests, typecheck, lint).
Ready for Sprint 2 (select and inputSlot nodes).
