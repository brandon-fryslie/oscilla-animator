Completed: Phase 2 IR Schema - 3D types, camera/mesh tables, new opcodes | Files: 4 | Commits: 1
Tests: N/A (type definitions only)
Cache invalidated: 0 entries (new feature, no existing cache)
Status: complete

Summary:
Phase 2 of 3D Projection Initiative completed successfully. Added complete IR schema
for 3D support including camera IR, mesh IR (extrusion-only), Instance2DBufferRef,
and performance counters.

Deliverables:
1. Created types3d.ts with CameraIR, CameraEval, CameraTable
2. Created MeshIR (extrusion-only), MeshBufferRef, MeshTable
3. Created Instance2DBufferRef for projection output
4. Created StepPerfCounters for 3D step instrumentation
5. Extended CompiledProgramIR with optional cameras and meshes tables
6. Added 3 new OpCodes: CameraEval (720), MeshMaterialize (721), Instances3DProjectTo2D (722)
7. Added "3d" category to OpCodeCategory enum
8. Exported all new types from ir/index.ts

All types are properly documented with references to design docs.
No runtime implementation yet - this is schema-only phase.
TypeCheck passed (pre-existing errors unrelated to this work).
