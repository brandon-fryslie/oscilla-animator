Completed: Added test geometry materialization step for circles | Files: 6 | Commits: 0
Cache invalidated: None (no cache exists yet)
Status: complete

CHANGES:
- Added StepMaterializeTestGeometry type to schedule.ts
- Created executeMaterializeTestGeometry.ts step executor
- Updated buildSchedule.ts to emit test geometry step for positions/radius
- Updated ScheduleExecutor.ts to dispatch materializeTestGeometry
- Updated RuntimeState.ts to register test geometry step slots
- Updated executeRenderAssemble.ts to determine instance count from buffers
- Exported StepMaterializeTestGeometry from compiler/ir/index.ts

IMPLEMENTATION:
The test geometry step creates hardcoded position and radius data for circles in a grid pattern.
This allows the IR rendering pipeline to render visible circles without needing full field materialization.
The step allocates x, y, and radius Float32Array buffers and populates them with test data (centered grid, fixed radius).

VALIDATION:
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- All IR-related types properly exported
- Step executors properly wired into dispatch
- Build process completes successfully

REMAINING:
The renderer should now be able to display circles when the IR pipeline is enabled.
Next step is to test visually in the browser to confirm circles render.
