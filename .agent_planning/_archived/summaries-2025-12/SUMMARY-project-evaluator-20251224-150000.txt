Scope: topic/type-unification
Completion: 40% | Gaps: 3 critical | Workflow: CONTINUE
Ambiguities: 3 found | Decisions needed: 1 (domain naming)

Key Findings:
- TypeDesc interface exists (production-ready)
- Zero IR infrastructure exists (src/editor/ir/ missing)
- Missing bridge utilities (valueKindToTypeDesc, slotTypeToTypeDesc)
- Domain naming divergence (HANDOFF: phase01, Current: phase)
- No TypeDesc test coverage

Critical Decision Required:
- Domain naming convention (HANDOFF vs current) - BLOCKER

Next Actions:
1. User clarifies domain naming (1h)
2. Create IR directory structure (30m)
3. Implement bridge utilities (4h)
4. Write test suite (3h)

Risk: LOW (isolated type definitions, zero runtime impact)
