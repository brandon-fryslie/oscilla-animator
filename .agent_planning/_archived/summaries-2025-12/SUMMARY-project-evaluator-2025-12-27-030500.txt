Scope: ui-prep-refactor (19 design docs in design-docs/10-Refactor-for-UI-prep/)
Completion: 35-40% | Gaps: 7 of 9 original issues incomplete
Tests: 79 failures | Lint: 826 errors | Test Quality: 3/5

Reused: 0 findings (fresh evaluation)
Fresh: 19 spec evaluations

Cache updated: None (topic-specific eval, not caching)

Workflow: CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- Port Identity (2-PortIdentity.md): DONE - PortRef uses slotId+direction
- Time Authority (3-Time.md): DONE - Player time monotonic
- Semantic Kernel: 50% - Types exist, implementation stub
- Op System: Types DONE, applyOp stub
- Layout Separation: NOT STARTED
- TimeRoot auto-publish: NOT STARTED
- Validator Integration: NOT STARTED

Dependencies:
  Port Identity -> Semantic Graph -> Validator -> Kernel -> Stores
  Time Authority -> TimeRoot auto-publish -> Implicit bindings

-> Next: Fix 79 test failures, then complete kernel applyOp implementation
