Completed: Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in test files | Files: 4 | Commits: 0
Tests: TypeScript now compiles cleanly (was failing with 40+ errors)
Cache invalidated: none (no architecture changes, only test fixture updates)
Status: complete

## Summary

Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors in runtime test files that were preventing tests from running.

## Root Cause

Test files were creating minimal CompiledProgramIR fixtures but were missing required IR tables:
- `signalTable` (SignalExprTable) - required by executeMaterialize 
- Also had API mismatches (wrong param names, missing required fields)

## Changes Made

1. **stepDispatch.test.ts**
   - Added signalTable to createMinimalProgram
   - Fixed StepNodeEval: added required `phase` field
   - Fixed StepBusEval: changed `inputSlots` → removed, added `busType`, `combine.strategy` → `mode`, `silent.value` → `constId`
   - Fixed executeNodeEval call: removed 4th param (was passing effectiveTime incorrectly)
   - Fixed executeDebugProbe call: reduced from 3 to 2 params

2. **ScheduleExecutor.test.ts**
   - Added signalTable (SignalExprTable) import and initialization
   - Fixed TypeDesc: removed `channels` field (doesn't exist in IR)
   - Added StepNodeEval `phase` field
   - Fixed StepBusEval: added `busType`, fixed combine/silent specs

3. **IRRuntimeAdapter.test.ts**
   - Added signalTable to createTestProgram
   - Fixed TypeDesc: removed `channels` field

4. **IRRuntimeIntegration.test.ts**
   - Added signalTable to createMinimalProgram
   - Fixed Player API usage: changed `player.step()` → `player.scrubTo()`
   - Fixed createPlayer API: proper function signature (callback first param, not object with initialProgram)
   - Fixed TypeDesc: removed `channels` field

## Test Status

TypeScript compilation: PASS (0 errors, was 40+ errors)
Runtime tests: 10 failures (down from preventing compilation entirely)

Runtime failures are expected - they're due to RenderFrameIR vs RenderTree type mismatch during IR transition. This is a separate architectural issue beyond the scope of fixing TypeScript errors.
