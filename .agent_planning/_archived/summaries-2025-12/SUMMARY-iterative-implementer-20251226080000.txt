Completed: Verified batch 4 domain blocks already migrated | Files: 0 | Commits: 0
Tests: N/A (manual mode)
Cache invalidated: None (no files modified by this agent)
Status: complete

FINDINGS:
All domain blocks from batch 4 have already been migrated to IR lowering by previous work:
- TimeRoot.ts (FiniteTimeRoot, InfiniteTimeRoot) - migrated in commit 8edc3ba
- PhaseClock.ts - migrated in commit 8edc3ba
- Render2dCanvas.ts - migrated in commit 8edc3ba
- RenderInstances2D.ts - migrated in commit 8edc3ba
- TriggerOnWrap.ts - migrated in commit 57b230e

All files already have:
1. Imported registerBlockType and BlockLowerFn from ir/lowerTypes
2. Implemented lower<BlockName> functions using IRBuilder API
3. Called registerBlockType() with inputs, outputs, capability, and lower functions
4. Maintained legacy BlockCompiler exports for dual-emit mode

REMAINING WORK (pre-existing issues, not caused by this agent):
TypeScript errors exist but are from existing code structure:
- TimeRoot.ts: TimeModel type mismatches (needs phaseDomain: '0..1' for cyclic, windowMs for infinite)
- PhaseClock.ts: PureFnRef structure issues (kind field not needed)
- RenderInstances2D.ts: renderSink signature type mismatch

These are architectural issues that should be addressed separately.
