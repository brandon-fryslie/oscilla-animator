Scope: project/SignalExpr-runtime-integration
Completion: 30% | Gaps: 4 major | Test Quality: 5/5 (for what exists)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: all findings
Cache updated: None (single evaluation)
Ambiguities: 0 found | Workflow: CONTINUE

Critical Finding: SigEvaluator is complete and tested BUT NOT WIRED into production runtime.

Key Gaps:
1. Block compilers still emit closures, not IR
2. No SignalExprTable produced during compilation
3. Player.renderOnce uses program.signal (closure), not evalSig
4. StateBuffer not managed by runtime lifecycle
5. MIGRATED_BLOCKS is empty (0/28 blocks)

Reality: Sprint 7 created excellent infrastructure but documented it as "validated" when
it only works in isolated tests. Production rendering is 100% closure-based.

-> Next: Sprint 8 must focus on compiler pipeline integration before more block migration.
