Status: complete

Work Completed:
- P0-2: Pass 7 - Bus Lowering to IR
  - Created pass7-bus-lowering.ts with bus→combine node translation
  - Handles signal/field buses with all combine modes (sum, last, average, max, min, layer)
  - Creates default values for empty buses
  - 13 tests covering all scenarios

- P0-3: Pass 8 - Link Resolution
  - Created pass8-link-resolution.ts with port→ValueRef resolution
  - Creates BlockInputRootIR and BlockOutputRootIR tables
  - Resolves wire connections and bus listeners
  - Reports appropriate errors for dangling connections
  - 6 tests covering outputs, wires, and error handling

- Extended CompileErrorCode with 4 new error types:
  - BusLoweringFailed
  - DanglingConnection
  - DanglingBindingEndpoint
  - UnresolvedPort

Next Steps:
- P0-4: Dual-Emit Compiler Integration (add emitIR flag to compileBusAware)
- P0-5: IR Validator Core
- P0-6: IR Validator Integration
- P1-1: Golden Patch IR Test
- P1-2: Documentation

All tests pass. Ready for P0-4.
