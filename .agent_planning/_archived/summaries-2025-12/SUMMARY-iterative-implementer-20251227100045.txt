Status: complete

=== Validation Results ===

D1) RenderAssemble → Paths2D Pass: VALID ✓
  - buildPathsPass correctly reads all required slots (cmds, params, indexing)
  - Style slots handled correctly (scalar or buffer for fill/stroke/width/opacity)
  - Paths2DPassIR assembly matches IR specification
  - Draw flags correctly derived from available style slots

D2) Canvas Renderer Implementation: VALID ✓
  - Path decoding uses PathEncodingIR v1 semantics correctly
  - Command consumption: M=1pt, L=1pt, Q=2pt, C=3pt, Z=0pt
  - Indexing logic correct (pointIndex tracks xy pairs, not floats)
  - Style attributes applied per-path or scalar as specified
  - Full Canvas2D feature support (fillRule, lineCap/Join, miter, dash)

Additional Validations:
  - Slot names align between schedule builder and renderer ✓
  - Buffer sizes adequate (min 64 cmds, 128 params, grows as needed) ✓
  - Per-path indexing matches materialization output ✓

Note: pathPointLen buffer is read but not used in rendering - this is correct.
The implicit point consumption from command types is sufficient and matches the spec.

=== Conclusion ===

The Paths2D pipeline is COMPLETE and CORRECT. No implementation fixes required.
All components (schedule builder, materializer, assembler, renderer) are properly
aligned and implement the design specification accurately.

Next steps: Test with actual path blocks (Workstreams A, B, C).
