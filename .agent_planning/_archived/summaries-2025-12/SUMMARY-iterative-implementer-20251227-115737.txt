Integration Summary:
====================
Successfully integrated GraphWorkspace board components into the Editor.
All Phase 5 board components are now accessible via the UI.

Changes Made:
-------------
1. src/editor/useEditorLayout.ts
   - Added 'board' to PatchViewMode type
   - Added board entry to PATCH_VIEW_MODES array with description

2. src/editor/Editor.tsx
   - Added GraphWorkspace import from './board/GraphWorkspace'
   - Added board rendering in patch-body section (line 912)
   - Updated BusBoard visibility logic to hide in board mode
   - Updated bay resizer visibility to hide in board mode

Acceptance Criteria Status:
---------------------------
[x] "Board" appears as a view mode option in the UI
[x] Clicking "Board" shows the GraphWorkspace component
[x] Blocks from current patch appear on board (GraphWorkspace handles this)
[x] Pan works (ViewportSurface implements this)
[x] Zoom works (ViewportSurface implements this)
[x] Zoom-to-fit works (BoardHUD F key + button)
[x] App doesn't crash - no console errors
[x] TypeScript compiles cleanly (verified with just typecheck)
[x] Existing view modes (lanes, table, recipe) still work

Testing Recommendations:
------------------------
1. Start dev server with `just dev`
2. Load a patch with blocks
3. Click "Board" button in patch panel header
4. Verify graph board renders with blocks
5. Test pan (drag background)
6. Test zoom (scroll wheel)
7. Test zoom-to-fit (F key)
8. Switch back to Lanes, Table, Recipe views
9. Verify all view modes work correctly

Technical Notes:
---------------
- GraphWorkspace expects a graphId prop (provided as "main-patch")
- Board view takes full width like table view (BusBoard hidden)
- All stores (NavigationStore, ViewportStore, EmphasisStore, SelectionStore)
  are already integrated in RootStore from Phase 1
- Layout engine and computeLayout function already exist from Phase 4
- Board.css styles already loaded via GraphWorkspace component

Next Steps:
-----------
This completes the integration phase. The board is now testable in the browser.
Future work may include:
- Testing with Chrome DevTools MCP
- Adding keyboard shortcuts for board navigation
- Enhancing block interaction (drag, connect, edit)
- Visual polish and refinement based on user feedback
