Scope: Sprint 3 (bus-block-unification) - P0 completion check
Completion: 88% (5 failing tests down from 43) | Gaps: 5 composite tests | Test Quality: Good
Reused: Previous STATUS findings | Fresh: Test failure analysis, commit review
Cache updated: None (no stable patterns to cache yet)
Ambiguities: Composite test failures - need investigation to triage
Workflow: INVESTIGATE FIRST, then CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- 38 tests fixed across 8 files (HistoryStore, TxBuilder, ops, BusStore.events, migrations)
- Pattern: userBlocks helper excludes BusBlocks from counts (resolves most failures)
- Pattern: Unified transforms field migration complete (Track A.5)
- Blocker: 5 composite.expansion.test.ts failures - compilation errors, not logged
- Uncommitted: BusBlock skip logic in compileBusAware.ts (lines 513-518, 608-612)
- Root cause unknown: Need error logging in D1/D2 tests to diagnose

Recommended Action:
1. Add error logging to composite tests (like line 87-89 pattern)
2. Run tests to see actual compile errors
3. Triage: Bus-related (fix now) vs Lens-binding (skip, defer Sprint 4)
4. Clear P0 gate, then start P1-A (remove Pass 6 bus check)

Sprint 3 P1/P2 work is READY once P0 gate clears (all 8 files analyzed, changes safe)

Next Steps:
-> Investigate composite test failures (1 hour)
-> Decide: fix or skip based on error type
-> If skipped: Begin Sprint 3 P1 (remove compiler bus checks)
-> If bus-related: Debug and fix before P1

Output: STATUS-2026-01-01-update.md
