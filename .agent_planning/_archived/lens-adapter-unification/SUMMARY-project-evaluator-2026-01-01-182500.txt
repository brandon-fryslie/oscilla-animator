Scope: project/lens-adapter-unification
Completion: 85% (infrastructure) | 0% (population) | Gaps: CRITICAL
Reused: 0 findings (no prior eval) | Fresh: full evaluation
Cache updated: None (no stable findings to cache)
Ambiguities: 4 found (registration pattern, module org, scope rules, lensParam transforms)
Workflow: PAUSE (clarification needed before implementation)

CRITICAL FINDING: TransformRegistry infrastructure is complete and integrated,
but the registry is EMPTY - no adapters or lenses are actually registered.
All code paths are wired correctly but will return undefined on lookups.

Track A (unified storage): COMPLETE ✅
Track B (registry population): NOT STARTED ❌
Track C (UI integration): NOT STARTED ❌

Estimated effort post-clarification: 17-24 hours (core), 26-38 hours (with IR)

Required decisions from user:
1. Registration code location (centralized vs distributed)
2. Adapter module organization (inline vs separate files)
3. Lens scope policy (which lenses allow which scopes)
4. LensParam transform support (should bindings have transforms field?)

-> User must answer ambiguity questions before implementer can proceed
-> See STATUS file §5 (Ambiguities Requiring Clarification)
