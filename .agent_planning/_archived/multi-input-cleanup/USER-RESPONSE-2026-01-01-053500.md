# User Response: Bus/Slot CombinePolicy Unification

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-01-053500
**Decision**: APPROVED

## Response

The user approved full unification despite the evaluator's concerns about type safety:

> "Proceed - unify fully"

## Approved Plan Files

- **PLAN**: `.agent_planning/multi-input-cleanup/PLAN-2026-01-01-052959.md`
- **DOD**: `.agent_planning/multi-input-cleanup/DOD-2026-01-01-052959.md`

## Acknowledged Trade-offs

1. Buses could accept 'error' or 'first' modes (will need runtime validation)
2. Violates original design spec (§6.2) but user prefers consistency
3. ~35 files, 4-6 hours effort

## Next Steps

Proceed to implementation via `/do:impl multi-input-cleanup`

---

**Plan approved and ready for implementation.**
