Completed: Fixed 4 lint errors in compiler passes | Files: 3 | Commits: 1
Cache invalidated: None (no eval cache entries exist yet)
Status: complete

Summary:
Fixed all lint errors introduced by Type Contracts + IR Plumbing implementation.

Changes made:
1. pass8-link-resolution.ts (lines 126-127): Replaced truthy checks with explicit !== undefined
2. pass2-types.ts (line 346): Removed unnecessary 'as TypeDesc' assertion
3. pass7-bus-lowering.ts (lines 63-64): Removed unnecessary type assertions

All changes were safe removals of redundant type assertions:
- Bus.type is already TypeDesc (no assertion needed)
- Editor and IR TypeDesc are the same type (re-exported)
- Explicit null/undefined checks satisfy strict boolean linting

Verification:
- just check passes (0 errors, 55 warnings - all pre-existing)
- All tests pass (895 tests across 48 files)
