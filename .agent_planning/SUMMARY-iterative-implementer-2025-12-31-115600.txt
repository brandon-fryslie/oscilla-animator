## Summary

Fixed 2 typecheck errors in oscillatorSpec.ts by converting IRTypeDesc (2-field format) to TypeDesc (4-field format with category and busEligible).

## Work Completed

1. Added `toTypeDesc()` helper function in oscillatorSpec.ts
2. Updated OSCILLATOR_IR_INPUTS and OSCILLATOR_IR_OUTPUTS to use toTypeDesc()
3. Reduced typecheck errors from 25 to 23

## Remaining Work

23 typecheck errors remain, primarily in test files:
- src/editor/compiler/blocks/domain/__tests__/RenderInstances3D.test.ts (2 errors - syntax)
- src/editor/compiler/ir/__tests__/builder.test.ts (2 errors - syntax)
- src/editor/compiler/ir/__tests__/buildSchedule.test.ts (3 errors - syntax)
- src/editor/compiler/ir/__tests__/ValueStore.test.ts (2 errors - syntax)
- src/editor/compiler/passes/__tests__/pass2-types.test.ts (2 errors - syntax)
- src/editor/compiler/passes/__tests__/pass3-time.test.ts (2 errors - syntax)
- src/editor/runtime/integration/__tests__/integration.test.ts (4 errors - syntax)
- src/editor/runtime/integration/__tests__/typeAdapter.test.ts (6 errors - syntax)

Note: Test file errors appear to be linter-introduced syntax corruption. Manual fixing attempts triggered automatic linting that corrupted imports. These files need to be fixed with linter disabled.

## Cache Invalidation

Removed adapter-application-status.md as it relates to adapter implementation which was modified in previous work.
