## Sprint 1 Complete: Binding Facade Foundation

Created unified bindings facade module that becomes the ONLY place in codebase that branches on wire/publisher/listener kind.

### Files Created
- src/editor/bindings/types.ts - Type system (BindingRef, NormalizedBinding, ResolvedBinding)
- src/editor/bindings/read.ts - Query functions (resolveBinding, getIncoming/Outgoing, etc)
- src/editor/bindings/write.ts - Mutations (disconnectBinding, setBindingEnabled)
- src/editor/bindings/index.ts - Public API exports

### Files Modified
- src/editor/stores/BusStore.ts - updateListener() now accepts adapterChain in updates (was missing)

### Validation
- TypeScript: CLEAN (no errors)
- Tests: PASSING (1063/1063)
- Sanity check: Facade imports without errors

### Key Features
- Single source of truth for binding resolution
- Normalized API (no optional fields)
- Foundation for 90% code reuse in lens/adapter editing
- Eliminates need for tri-array scans in UI

### Next: Sprint 2 - High-Value UI Migration
Will migrate ConnectionInspector, Inspector, PatchBay to use facade.
Estimated time: 2-3 hours

### Commit
f5e2445 feat(bindings): Add unified bindings facade (Sprint 1)
