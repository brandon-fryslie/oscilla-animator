Scope: module/fieldexpr-integration
Completion: 60% | Gaps: 4 major | Tests: 207 passing (field 63 + passes 144)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: all findings
Cache updated: fieldexpr-systems.md in eval-cache/
Ambiguities: 3 critical (type authority, signal eval, fieldexpr ownership)
Workflow: PAUSE (integration requires architectural decisions)

Key Findings:
- Two complete but disconnected implementations exist
- Runtime field system: 6 files, 1,542 lines, 63 tests - WORKS standalone
- Compiler passes 1-8: COMPLETE, 144 tests passing
- NO integration between compiler IR and runtime materializer
- evalSig stub returns 0, blocking broadcast functionality
- Three competing FieldExpr type systems need unification

Blockers:
1. Type system divergence (runtime TypeDesc != compiler TypeDesc)
2. Signal evaluation stub (requires Phase 4 or bridge)
3. No integration tests exist
4. Unclear which FieldExpr system is authoritative

Next Actions:
1. Clarify type authority (compiler vs runtime)
2. Decide signal evaluation strategy (wait Phase 4 or create bridge)
3. Create integration test once decisions made
