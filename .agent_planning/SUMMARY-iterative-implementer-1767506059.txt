Completed: D3 PatchStore Integration | Files: 2 | Commits: 0 (pending)
Tests: N/A (manual validation mode)
Cache invalidated: N/A (no eval cache entries yet)
Status: complete

Summary:
- Added invalidateNormalizedCache() method to PatchStore
- Added cache invalidation calls to applyOps.ts for all block/edge mutations
- Updated editorToPatch() to use getNormalizedGraph() (already done)
- pass0-materialize effectively removed (compileBusAware is deprecated, not called)
- Type system changes: NOTE - toCompilerGraph() not yet used due to CompilerPatch type constraints

Next Steps:
- Update CompilerPatch to use CompilerEdge instead of Edge (future work)
- Run manual tests to verify default source behavior
- Test undo/redo to verify cache invalidation works
