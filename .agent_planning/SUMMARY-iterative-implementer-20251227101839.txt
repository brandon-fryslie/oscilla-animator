WORK COMPLETED:
================
Workstream A - Editor & Block Definitions for Paths2D Pipeline

Task A1: Add UI block definitions for Path primitives
- Added PathConst block definition in src/editor/blocks/domain.ts
  - Takes Domain input only (no path input - path defined via params/config)
  - Outputs Field<path>
  - Simple, clean design following existing FieldConstNumber/FieldConstColor patterns
  - Priority 8 in Fields lane

- Fixed TypeScript errors in PathConst compiler (src/editor/compiler/blocks/domain/PathConst.ts)
  - Changed invalid 'Signal:path' and 'Field:path' types to correct 'Field:Path'
  - Removed unused path input from legacy compiler
  - Both IR lowering and legacy closure compiler now properly typed

Task A2: Ensure RenderPaths2D is in the palette
- Confirmed RenderPaths2D block exists in src/editor/blocks/domain.ts
- Confirmed RenderPaths2D compiler exists in src/editor/compiler/blocks/domain/RenderPaths2D.ts
- Confirmed both blocks are properly exported:
  - UI blocks: via src/editor/blocks/index.ts -> domain.ts export
  - Compiler blocks: via src/editor/compiler/blocks/domain/index.ts export
  - Main compiler index: src/editor/compiler/blocks/index.ts

VALIDATION:
===========
Mode: manual (no specific tests for UI block definitions)

TypeScript compilation:
- PathConst and RenderPaths2D now pass type checking
- No errors related to Paths2D implementation
- Remaining errors are in unrelated files (BusStore, buildSchedule) and pre-existed

Files match spec:
- design-docs/13-Renderer/12-Paths2D-Implementation-Plan.md §A1, §A2

REMAINING WORK:
===============
The following items from the Paths2D plan are NOT part of Workstream A:
- A3) Runtime executor step for paths2d render sink (already exists at src/editor/runtime/executor/steps/executeMaterializePath.ts)
- Workstream B (Compiler Integration) - separate task
- Workstream C (Runtime Execution) - separate task

NOTES:
======
- PathConst uses paramSchema: [] because path configuration will be added later
- PathConst follows the established pattern of FieldConstNumber/FieldConstColor
- Both PathConst and RenderPaths2D are now visible in the block palette
- The path type is correctly defined as 'Field:Path' in ValueKind
- SlotType uses 'Field<path>' (lowercase) while ValueKind uses 'Field:Path' (capitalized)
