Completed: ESLint fixes for board components | Files: 3 | Commits: 1
Status: complete

Summary:
--------
Fixed all ESLint warnings in src/editor/board/ files:
- BlockView.tsx
- BoardScene.tsx  
- GraphWorkspace.tsx

Changes Made:
-------------
1. strict-boolean-expressions fixes:
   - Changed implicit checks (!obj, obj) to explicit (=== undefined, !== undefined)
   - Changed implicit string checks to (!== '')
   - Changed implicit null checks to (=== null, !== null)

2. react-hooks/exhaustive-deps fixes:
   - Added viewportStore to dependency arrays in GraphWorkspace.tsx
   - Previously only viewport.density was included, but viewportStore itself is accessed

3. Type safety improvements:
   - Added proper type guard for filter predicate: (item): item is string => item !== null

All ESLint warnings resolved. No errors introduced.
