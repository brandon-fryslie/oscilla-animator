Task: Fix TypeScript type errors related to TypeDesc type change

Modified Files:
- /Users/bmf/code/oscilla-animator_codex/src/editor/graph/GraphNormalizer.ts
- /Users/bmf/code/oscilla-animator_codex/src/editor/kernel/PatchKernel.ts
- /Users/bmf/code/oscilla-animator_codex/src/editor/kernel/TransactionBuilder.ts

Changes Made:
1. GraphNormalizer.ts:
   - Updated extractDomain() to accept TypeDesc (core type) instead of IR TypeDesc
   - Simplified the function to just extract the domain property
   - Removed unused typeDescToString import

2. PatchKernel.ts:
   - Removed typeDescToString import (not needed)
   - toPatchDocument() now passes TypeDesc directly from slot.type
   - PatchDocument interface expects type: TypeDesc, not type: string

3. TransactionBuilder.ts:
   - Removed typeDescToString import (not needed)
   - patchToPatchDocument() now passes TypeDesc directly from slot.type
   - PatchDocument interface expects type: TypeDesc, not type: string

Root Cause:
The PatchDocument interface was updated to use SlotType (which is TypeDesc), not string.
The kernel files were incorrectly trying to convert TypeDesc to string, when they should
pass TypeDesc objects directly.

Verification:
All three target files now pass TypeScript type checking with no errors.
Other errors exist in validator.ts and its tests, but those are outside this task's scope.

Cache invalidated: None (no eval-cache entries existed for these files)
