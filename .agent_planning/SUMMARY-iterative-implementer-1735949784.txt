Completed: Fixed obsolete test files | Files: 2 (deleted 2) | Commits: 1
Tests: N/A (type errors fixed, not runtime tests)
Cache invalidated: None (no cache entries for test files)
Status: complete

Summary:
- Deleted obsolete test files that tested deprecated Bus/BusBlock APIs:
  * pass0-materialize.test.ts (tested addBus, busBlocks, getBusById - all removed)
  * composite.expansion.test.ts (tested deprecated Bus system)

- Fixed type errors in lenses.test.ts:
  * Signal:number → Signal:float (4 occurrences)
  * Scalar:number → Scalar:float (2 occurrences)

- Fixed function signature errors in replaceUtils.test.ts:
  * findCompatibleReplacements: added edges parameter
  * mapConnections: reordered parameters to (oldBlock, newDef, edges)
  * copyCompatibleParams: changed from (block, def) to (params, def)

Root cause: TypeDesc refactored from object format to string format (e.g., "Signal:float")
and Bus system APIs were deprecated/removed in recent refactoring.
