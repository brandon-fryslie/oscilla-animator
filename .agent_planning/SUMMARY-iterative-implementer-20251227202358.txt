Summary:
Fixed TypeScript type error at line 429 in /Users/bmf/code/oscilla-animator_codex/src/editor/compiler/integration.ts

The issue was that defaultSources was being assigned an array of DefaultSourceState objects, but the CompilerPatch type expects a Record<string, DefaultSourceState> keyed by "blockId:slotId".

Changed the editorToPatch function to build both defaultSources and defaultSourceValues Records using the same "blockId:slotId" key format by iterating through blocks and their inputs.

TypeScript now compiles successfully without errors.
