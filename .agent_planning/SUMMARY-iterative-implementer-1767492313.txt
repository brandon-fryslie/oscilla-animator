Status: complete - good progress toward target (<50 errors)

Summary of fixes:
1. LensChainEditor.tsx: Added type guards for UIControlHint discriminated union

Next batch to focus on:
- Missing properties in composite-related files (ExposedParam, slots)
- TypeDesc undefined handling in resolveWriters.ts
- Missing DebugUIStore methods (printLogs, clearPrintLogs)
- Missing PatchStore.updateBlockParams method
