Scope: compiler-audit-redflag/TypeWorld-unification (Issues #1, #4, #7)
Status: UNFIXED (all 3 issues remain as originally documented)
Previous Work: Sprint 1 fixed Issues #2,#3,#5,#6 but NOT #1,#4,#7
Risk: MEDIUM (Issue #1: type mismatch latent, Issue #4: silent landmine, Issue #7: duplicate of #1)
Workflow: CONTINUE (no ambiguities, clear fix paths)

Key Findings:
1. Issue #1 (TypeWorld vocab split): IR uses 'special', editor uses 'config' for same types
   - Affects ~20 files across compiler and runtime
   - Recommend: Unify to 'config' (semantically clearer)
   - Effort: 2-3 hours (mechanical search-replace + tests)

2. Issue #4 (Transform runtime error): Materializer throws "not implemented"
   - Currently SILENT (transform chains never created in compiler)
   - Two options: compile-time error (1-2h) OR full implementation (1-2 weeks)
   - Recommend: Compile error now, defer full impl to Sprint 4+ type conversion work

3. Issue #7 (Config vs special): Same as Issue #1, no separate fix needed

No ambiguities found. All issues have clear fix paths and low risk.

Recommendation: Fix Issue #1 (P1), add compile check for Issue #4 (P2), defer full transform impl.
