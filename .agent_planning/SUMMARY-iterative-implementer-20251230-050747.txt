Status: complete

Summary:
--------
Sprint 14 implemented successfully. Provider config panel now shows as read-only
when input is driven (by wire or bus listener), per user directive.

Implementation:
- Added isDriven prop to ProviderConfigPanel component
- ProviderConfigPanel passes isDriven to all DefaultSourceControl instances
- Driven inputs show full provider config (dropdown + controls) but disabled
- Undriven inputs remain fully editable
- isInputDriven helper already existed in portUtils.ts

Key Changes:
- src/editor/Inspector.tsx:
  - ProviderConfigPanel component (line 1313-1375): added isDriven prop
  - DefaultSourcesSection (line 1377-1527): shows provider config for both driven and undriven inputs
  - Driven section (lines 1485-1524): displays provider dropdown and config panel in read-only state

Acceptance Criteria Met:
✓ Helper isInputDriven exists (in portUtils.ts)
✓ Checks for wires and listeners
✓ Returns true if EITHER exists
✓ When driven: dropdown disabled, controls read-only, "overridden" shown
✓ When not driven: controls editable
✓ Wire/disconnect toggles state correctly (manual verification required)

Next Steps:
- Manual verification: wire/disconnect behavior
- Sprint 15: Add Oscillator provider (not in scope for this sprint)
