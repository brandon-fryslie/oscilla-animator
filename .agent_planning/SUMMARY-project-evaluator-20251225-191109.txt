Scope: worktree-integration/signalexpr-runtime-planning
Task Type: File copy operation (planning docs only)
Complexity: LOW | Risk: LOW | Ambiguities: NONE

Files to integrate:
- HANDOFF.md (root): 17KB spec document
- signalexpr-runtime/: 11 planning files (~180KB total)
- eval-cache/compiler-patterns.md: 4KB new cache file
- eval-cache/INDEX.md: merge (add 1 row)

Key finding: Current branch is AHEAD of worktree in implementation
- Worktree: 0% implementation (planning only)
- Current: IR files exist (opcodes.ts, signalExpr.ts, transforms.ts, IRBuilder*.ts)

Cache: No updates needed (this is integration evaluation, not code evaluation)
Workflow: CONTINUE (no blockers)
-> Implementer can copy 13 files with provided commands
