Completed: Added Error artifact type | Files: 1 | Commits: 1
Tests: N/A (manual validation via typecheck)
Cache invalidated: None (types.ts is core infrastructure, no eval cache exists)
Status: complete

Summary:
--------
Fixed missing Error artifact type in compiler types. Many block compilers
were returning {kind: "Error", message: string} on validation failures,
but this wasn't a valid Artifact union variant.

Change:
- Added Error variant to Artifact union type in src/editor/compiler/types.ts
- Error artifact has: kind: "Error", message: string, value?: undefined

This fixes type compatibility for 37+ block compilers that use Error artifacts:
- All Field block compilers in domain/ (FieldConstNumber, FieldColorize, etc.)
- Signal block compilers (AddSignal, MulSignal, etc.)
- Rhythm block compilers (EnvelopeAD, PulseDivider)

Validation:
- Ran typecheck - no errors related to Error artifact type
- Verified block compilers can now safely return Error artifacts
- Pre-existing type errors are unrelated (MobX compatibility, pass8 issues)
