Scope: project/renderer-ir (new subsystem)
Completion: 0% | Gaps: 8 major subsystems | Test Quality: N/A (no tests exist)
Reused: 0 findings (new evaluation) | Fresh: 47 findings
Cache updated: None (new topic)
Ambiguities: 4 minor (clarified with defaults) | Workflow: CONTINUE

Summary:
- Renderer IR is a LARGE new subsystem (8 design docs, 8-12 sprints for 2D, +4-5 for 3D)
- Zero implementation exists - this is greenfield work
- Infrastructure from Phases 1-6 provides solid foundation (TypeDesc, ValueStore, Materializer)
- Current render pipeline (RenderCmd, Canvas2DRenderer) is legacy - rewrite required
- Key gaps: RenderFrameIR types, color encoding migration, path geometry system, caching
- 3D projection is separate 4-5 sprint addition
-> Start with IR type definitions (Phase A), then Instances2D pipeline (Phase C)
