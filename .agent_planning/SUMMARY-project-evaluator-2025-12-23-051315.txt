CRITICAL AMBIGUITIES BLOCKING IMPLEMENTATION:
1. TimeRoot output specification - implementation conflicts with design docs
2. Auto-publication rules - InfiniteTimeRoot should not publish phase/pulse

SPEC VIOLATION DETECTED:
Implementation has extra outputs on FiniteTimeRoot and InfiniteTimeRoot that are NOT in the design specification.

Next: User must resolve spec vs implementation discrepancy before fixes can proceed.
