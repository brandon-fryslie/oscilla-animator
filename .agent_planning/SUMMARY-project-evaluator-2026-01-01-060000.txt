Agent: project-evaluator | 2026-01-01-060000
Scope: phase0.5-compat-cleanup/remaining-work
Completion: 35% | Gaps: 5 sprints + 2 tracks | Status: BROKEN
Reused: 4 findings from STATUS-2026-01-01.md
Fresh: TypeScript compilation errors (52), Track B breakage analysis
Cache updated: None (evaluation only)
Ambiguities: 4 found (Track B deletion intent, type definition changes)
Workflow: PAUSE - Fix 52 TypeScript errors before proceeding

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- TypeScript build BROKEN: 52 compilation errors
- Track B claimed "100% complete" but missing migration files
- transforms/index.ts imports deleted migrateLenses/migrateAdapters
- Bus.combineMode property errors (19 test files)
- LensParamBinding.type property errors (13 test cases)

BLOCKER: Cannot run tests until TS errors fixed

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Remove transforms/index.ts:18-19 (import missing files)
2. Fix Bus type usage (combineMode vs combine?)
3. Fix LensParamBinding type in tests
4. Verify Track B actual completion status

REMAINING WORK:
- Sprint 1 (Edges Authoritative): 70% remaining (4-5 days)
- Track A (Transform Storage): 20% remaining (2-3 days)
- Sprint 2 (Compiler Edges-Only): 100% remaining (5-7 days)
- Sprint 3 (Remove Migration Helpers): 100% remaining (1 day)
- Sprint 4 (Clean Type Definitions): 100% remaining (3-5 days)
- Sprint 5 (PatchStore Cleanup): 100% remaining (3-5 days)

TOTAL EFFORT: 3-4 weeks after fixes

-> NEXT: Fix TypeScript compilation (2-4 hours)
-> THEN: Complete Sprint 1 + Track A
-> SEQUENCE: Sprint 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
