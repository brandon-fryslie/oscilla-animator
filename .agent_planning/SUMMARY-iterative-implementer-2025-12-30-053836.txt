=== Sprint 8: Runtime State Inspector - COMPLETE ===

Deliverables Completed:
1. RuntimeSnapshot.ts - Snapshot capture with JSON serialization
2. RuntimeStateTree.tsx - Expandable tree UI component
3. RuntimeStateTab.tsx - DebugDrawer tab integration
4. RuntimeSnapshot.test.ts - Comprehensive test suite (9 tests, all passing)
5. DebugUIStore.ts - Updated to include 'runtime-state' tab
6. DebugDrawer.tsx - Added Runtime State tab
7. CSS files for styling

Key Features Implemented:
- captureRuntimeSnapshot() function captures ValueStore slots with types and values
- JSON-serializable snapshot format with metadata (frameId, timestamp, slotCount)
- Typed array serialization (Float32Array, etc.) with 100-element truncation
- RuntimeStateTree component with expand/collapse and search/filter
- RuntimeStateTab with "Capture Snapshot" button and error handling
- Full integration into DebugDrawer with new tab

Test Results:
- All 9 new tests passing
- Full test suite: 2596 passed, 10 skipped, 10 todo
- TypeScript compilation: SUCCESS (no errors)

Known Limitations:
- StateBuffer snapshot currently returns empty cells array (StateLayout not accessible from RuntimeState)
- Runtime access via window.__executor global (temporary until proper service implemented)

Next Steps:
- This completes Sprint 8 and the entire Debug + Export workstream!
- All 8 sprints are now complete
- Runtime state inspector is ready for use
