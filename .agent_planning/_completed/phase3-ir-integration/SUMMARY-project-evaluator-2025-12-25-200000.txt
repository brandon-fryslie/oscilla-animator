Completion: 35% | Gaps: 5 topics | Test Quality: 4/5

Cache updated: N/A (no eval-cache for this topic)
Ambiguities: 2 critical found | Workflow: PAUSE

Key Findings:
- IRBuilder (P0): COMPLETE - 4 files, 24 tests passing
- Pass 1 Normalize (P2): COMPLETE - 2 files, 14 tests passing
- Pass 2-5: NOT STARTED - types defined but no implementation
- Dual Emit: NOT STARTED - major architectural work
- IR Validator: NOT STARTED

Critical Ambiguities:
1. Block compiler contract undefined - how do blocks emit IR?
2. TypeDesc divergence - editor vs IR type systems differ

Blocking Issues:
- Cannot proceed with Pass 6+ without clarifying block compiler contract
- 17 block compiler files need modification strategy

-> Recommend: Clarify block compiler contract before continuing
