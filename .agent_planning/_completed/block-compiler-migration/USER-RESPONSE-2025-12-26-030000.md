## Approval Context
User approved the parallel workstream plan for migrating 13 Signal blocks from closure-returning to IR-emitting.

## Workstream Summary
- **Workstream A**: IR lowering types (BLOCKING prerequisite)
- **Workstream B**: Signal blocks 1-7 (parallel)
- **Workstream C**: Signal blocks 8-13 (parallel)
- **Workstream D**: Domain IR design (parallel)
- **Integration**: Test suite (after B+C)

## Next Steps
1. Execute Workstream A first (creates required types)
2. Launch Workstreams B, C, D in parallel
3. Complete integration testing
4. Proceed to Phase 4 audit and planning
