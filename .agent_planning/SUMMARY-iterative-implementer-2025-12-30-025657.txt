Sprint 1 COMPLETE - TypeScript Compilation Fixed

Issue Found:
- File: src/editor/__tests__/bus-compilation.test.ts
- Line 27: Stray '"' character at the beginning of the line
- This was causing a syntax error: malformed string quote

Fix Applied:
- Removed the stray '"' from line 27
- The line should be: `combineMode: 'last',`
- Was: `'"      combineMode: 'last',`

Verification:
✓ just typecheck - passes with no errors
✓ just test - 1152 tests pass, 4 skipped
✓ just build - production build succeeds (warnings about chunk size are expected)

Commit: 7c32403 "fix(test): Remove stray quote in bus-compilation.test.ts"

Ready for Sprint 2: Deterministic IDs Foundation
