Scope: work/port-identity-quick-fix
Completion: Quick Fix 100% | Architecture 0% | Build BROKEN
Reused: 1 previous eval | Cache: test infrastructure
Ambiguities: 1 found (semantic validator integration policy)
Workflow: CONTINUE (port work done) | PAUSE (fix broken tests first)

QUICK FIX SPRINT: ✅ COMPLETE
- BindingEndpoint migration (70+ files)
- CycleTimeRoot phaseA → phase rename
- Port validation in compileBusAware
- 738/738 tests passing at completion

ARCHITECTURAL GAPS: ⚠️ DEFERRED (AS PLANNED)
- Composite port maps (boundary enforcement)
- Type-based port resolution
- Stable slotId versioning
- Two-phase compilation model

CRITICAL ISSUE: ❌ 18 TEST FAILURES (UNRELATED)
- Semantic Validator (commit e4f3ee7) broke wire events
- Preflight validation rejecting valid connections
- NOT a regression from port identity work
- Needs separate investigation/fix

NEXT: Fix semantic validator test failures before proceeding
