# User Response: Sprint Plan Approval
Generated: 2024-12-24

## Response: APPROVED (with adjustment)

## Context
User requested adjustment to P0 (Listener Panel Bug Fix) to clarify the block visibility requirements:

**Adjustment Made:**
- Clarified that ALL blocks in the patch with bus-eligible ports MUST appear
- Blocks with input ports → Listeners section
- Blocks with output ports → Publishers section
- Many blocks appear on BOTH sides
- NO filtering by arbitrary categories
- Blocks with zero bus-eligible ports should log error to diagnostics

## Approved Plan Files
