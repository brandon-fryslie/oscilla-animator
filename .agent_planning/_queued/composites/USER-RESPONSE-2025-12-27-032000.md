# User Response: Composite Library Sprint Plan

**Date:** 2025-12-27-032000
**Decision:** APPROVED (with scope adjustment)

## Approved Plan Files
- `PLAN-2025-12-27-030608.md`
- `DOD-2025-12-27-030608.md`

## Scope Adjustment

**User Request:** "Approve except drop persistence and bring in parameter forwarding ui"

**Changes:**
1. **REMOVED:** P0 User Composite Persistence
   - Reason: User preference (defer to future sprint)

2. **ADDED:** P2 Parameter Forwarding UI → promoted to P0
   - Reason: User priority

## Final Sprint Scope

### P0 Deliverables (Approved)

1. **Enable Built-in Composite Display** (2 hours)
   - Uncomment `listCompositeDefinitions` import in BlockLibrary.tsx
   - Expose 23 built-in composites in palette

2. **Custom Composite Creation UI** (2-3 days)
   - Multi-select blocks → Right-click → "Save as Composite"
   - Dialog with name, description, exposed ports
   - Store in CompositeStore (in-memory only this sprint)

3. **Parameter Forwarding UI** (1-2 days)
   - Expose internal block parameters as composite-level parameters
   - Inspector shows forwarded parameters
   - Uses existing `__fromParam` mechanism

### Deferred (Future Sprints)
- User Composite Persistence (originally P0, now deferred)
- Composite Management UI (rename/delete/duplicate)
- Preview thumbnails
- Macro migration
- Composite nesting

## Notes
- Custom composites will NOT persist across browser refresh (persistence deferred)
- This is acceptable for MVP - users can recreate composites
- Parameter forwarding is more valuable for usability than persistence
