Scope: work/sprint1-connections
Verdict: INCOMPLETE
Criteria: 3/4 deliverables working | Breaks found: 1 (Pass 8 incomplete) | Ambiguities: 2
Previous issues: N/A (first evaluation)
Missing checks: 2 integration tests specified
Cache updated: edge-unification-status.md (complete rewrite)

Deliverable 1 (Edge Type & Migration): COMPLETE ✅
- All types defined correctly
- 27/27 migration tests passing
- Validation rejects bus→bus edges

Deliverable 2 (PatchStore): COMPLETE ✅
- edges array with addEdge/removeEdge
- Computed getters (wireEdges, publisherEdges, listenerEdges)
- Transaction integration working

Deliverable 3 (Compiler Passes): MOSTLY COMPLETE ⚠️
- Pass 2: ✅ Uses unified edges when present
- Pass 6: ⚠️ DOD criterion incorrect (doesn't do input resolution)
- Pass 7: ✅ Uses unified edges when present
- Pass 8: ❌ Accepts edges parameter but doesn't use it (line 536: void edges;)

Critical Issue:
Pass 8 buildBlockInputRoots() still uses legacy wires.find() and listeners.find()
instead of unified edge lookup. The edges parameter is accepted but suppressed
with void edges; comment. This defeats the purpose of Sprint 1.

All 2779 tests pass because backward compatibility maintained via legacy arrays.

Next action: Complete Pass 8 unified edge implementation (2-3 hours estimated)
