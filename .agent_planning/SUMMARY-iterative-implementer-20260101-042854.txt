Commit: d5e773f - refactor(compiler): Unify bus combine logic using shared createCombineNode()

Validation:
- TypeScript: just typecheck - PASS
- Tests: Pass 7 tests - 13/13 PASS
- Behavior: IR output unchanged (same combine nodes)
- Code quality: -76 lines removed, +28 added (net -48 lines)

Next Steps:
- Task complete, no further work required
- Pass 7 now uses same combine logic as Pass 6 (multi-input blocks)
