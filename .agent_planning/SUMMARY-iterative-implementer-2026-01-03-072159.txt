## Summary

Updated `.agent_planning/ROADMAP.md` to mark Phase 0 (Architecture Refactoring) and Phase 0.5 (Compatibility Cleanup) as COMPLETED.

## Changes Made

### Phase 0: Architecture Refactoring [COMPLETED]
- Updated header from [ACTIVE - TOP PRIORITY] to [COMPLETED]
- Added completion date: 2026-01-03
- Marked all core topics as [COMPLETED]:
  - unify-connections-edge
  - unify-default-sources-blocks
  - v2-adapter-implementation
  - unify-lenses-adapters
- Added "Files modified:" sections documenting actual implementation
- Updated completion gate with checkmarks for completed items
- Added note explaining that graph-normalization and block-edge-roles were deferred (not blocking)

### Phase 0.5: Compatibility Cleanup [COMPLETED]
- Updated header from [QUEUED] to [COMPLETED]
- Added start date: 2026-01-02
- Added completion date: 2026-01-03
- Marked all topics as [COMPLETED]:
  - remove-connection-facades
  - remove-default-source-facades
  - remove-registry-facades
  - serialization-version-bump
- Added "Work items completed:" sections documenting actual cleanup
- Updated completion gate with all checkmarks

### Global Updates
- Updated timestamp to 2026-01-03
- Updated priority override section to note refactoring is COMPLETE
- Maintained historical context and implementation details for reference

## Validation

No code changes - documentation only. The ROADMAP now accurately reflects:
- Phase 0: Core architecture unifications complete (edges, default sources, V2 adapter, transforms)
- Phase 0.5: Backward compatibility cleanup complete (deprecated types removed, edges required)
- Two topics (graph-normalization, block-edge-roles) deferred as non-blocking

The codebase is now ready for Phase 6 work with a clean, unified foundation.
