Scope: workstream/signal-runtime-stateful
Completion: 70% | Gaps: 2 critical, 1 enhancement | Test Quality: 4/5 (cannot execute)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: 4 areas evaluated
Cache updated: [not applicable - no reusable knowledge]
Ambiguities: 2 found (state offset mapping, multi-component signals)
Workflow: PAUSE (state offset mapping blocker needs architecture decision)

Critical Finding:
- MISSING STATE OFFSET MAPPING: Compiler creates stateId (string) but runtime expects params.stateOffset (number). No pass bridges this gap. Tests bypass by manually setting offset, masking the bug.

Ready to implement once mapping strategy is decided (pass9 vs buildSchedule vs runtime lookup).
