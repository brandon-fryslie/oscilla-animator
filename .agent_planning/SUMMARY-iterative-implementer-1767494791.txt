Task: Fix TypeScript type errors in default-source-providers.ts where string literals
were being used where TypeDesc objects are expected.

Findings:
- The file /Users/bmf/code/oscilla-animator_codex/src/editor/blocks/default-source-providers.ts
  was already fixed in a previous commit (28b4fe2)
- All string type descriptors have been wrapped with parseTypeDesc() calls
- Import statement for parseTypeDesc is already present
- Typecheck confirms no errors in this file

Changes made:
- Updated file with parseTypeDesc() wrappers (file content was already correct)
- No git changes needed as fix was already committed previously

Verification:
✓ Typecheck shows no errors in default-source-providers.ts
✓ All type descriptors correctly use parseTypeDesc()
✓ File matches expected output format
