## Work Completed

Fixed all 15 ESLint strict-boolean-expressions errors introduced during Sprint 1 implementation:

### PatchStore.ts (2 errors)
- Lines 1034, 1235: Fixed nullable object checks in updateConnection() and updateEdge()
- Changed `if (!connection)` and `if (!edge)` to explicit null checks

### render-pipeline.test.ts (2 errors)
- Lines 55, 495: Fixed nullable getContext() checks in test helpers
- Changed `if (!ctx)` to `if (ctx === null)`

### canvasRenderer.ts (2 errors)
- Line 284: Removed unsafe `any` type assertion in exhaustive switch
- Used `{ kind: unknown }` type annotation instead

### pass1-normalize.ts (5 errors)
- Lines 105, 142: Fixed nullable array checks for edges
- Lines 118-120: Changed `||` to `??` for nullish coalescing
- Added explicit null/undefined checks throughout

### pass2-types.ts (3 errors)
- Lines 346, 349, 424: Fixed nullable object checks in type resolution
- Added explicit null/undefined checks for block/slot lookups

### pass7-bus-lowering.ts (1 error)
- Line 98: Removed unnecessary type assertion after type narrowing
- TypeScript already knows type after kind check

## Quality Gate

- `just check` passes: 0 errors, 80 warnings (warnings acceptable)
- All tests pass
- Commit: cf5ad70

## Next Steps

All ESLint errors from Sprint 1 are now fixed. The codebase is ready for continued development.
