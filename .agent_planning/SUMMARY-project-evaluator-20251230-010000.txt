Scope: project/unified-bindings
Completion: 0% | Gaps: 0 | Test Quality: N/A
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: Complete evaluation
Cache updated: [none - this is initial evaluation]
Ambiguities: 0 found | Workflow: CONTINUE
Next: Begin Sprint 1 - Create bindings facade foundation

Key Findings:
- TypeScript: CLEAN (1063 tests passing)
- Data model: Already 90% unified (Connection/Publisher/Listener)
- Duplication: 5+ copies of "find compatible buses", 3+ tri-array scans
- Blockers: NONE
- Ready to implement immediately

Architecture Validation:
- SemanticGraph already unifies edges (WireEdge|PublisherEdge|ListenerEdge)
- Store APIs all exist, just need thin wrappers
- Input writer invariant already enforced correctly

Implementation Path:
1. Create src/editor/bindings/ with types/read/write modules
2. Migrate ConnectionInspector, Inspector, PatchBay to use facade
3. Optional: BusInspector, BusPicker, PublishMenu
4. Manual verification via Chrome DevTools MCP

Risk: LOW - Additive change, reversible, no breaking changes to data model
