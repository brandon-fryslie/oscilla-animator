Scope: project/full (compiler IR-only blockers)
Completion: 0% (blocked) | Gaps: 43 documented issues + 1 critical blocker
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: 44 findings (43 red flags + 1 infrastructure)
Cache updated: None (waiting for test fix to baseline)
Ambiguities: 4 found | Workflow: PAUSE

CRITICAL BLOCKER: Test suite broken - 27 test files fail at module load due to block registry validation. Must fix before evaluating IR red flags.

Summary of Red Flags:
- 16 CRITICAL issues (fundamentally break IR-only mode)
- 17 HIGH issues (cause incorrect behavior)
- 10 MEDIUM issues (inconsistencies/tech debt)
- Total: 43 documented issues across 7 categories

Key Findings:
1. Test infrastructure broken - blocks all runtime verification
2. IR compilation is optional and can fail silently to legacy mode
3. Pass 6 emits placeholder IR (not real semantics)
4. TimeModel hardcoded to infinite (breaks finite/cyclic patches)
5. Bus evaluation missing from schedule
6. Event buses have no IR representation
7. Type conversions unimplemented

Recommended Sprint Scope:
- Sprint 0 (1 day): Fix block registry validation
- Sprint 1 (1 week): Make IR mandatory, thread TimeModel, fix timeDerive
- Sprint 2 (2 weeks): Core block lowering
- Sprint 3 (2 weeks): Bus system
- Sprint 4 (2 weeks): Type system & transforms

Next: Fix src/editor/blocks/registry-validation.ts capability propagation issue
