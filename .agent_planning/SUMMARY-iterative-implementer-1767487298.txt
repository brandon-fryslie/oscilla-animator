Status: in_progress

Summary of work:
1. Updated UIControlHint from string union to discriminated union with kind property
   - Matches IR definition in compiler/ir/defaultSources.ts
   - Fixed 103 type errors across block definitions
   
2. Fixed Bus interface changes:
   - Changed Bus.combine → Bus.combineMode (simplified interface)
   - Updated bus-block.ts, conversion.ts, resolveWriters.ts
   - Fixed test fixtures in ops.test.ts
   - Removed legacy sortKey and origin fields
   - Fixed 25 type errors
   
3. Started fixing Block.inputs/outputs removal:
   - Fixed pass3-time.test.ts Block fixtures
   - Need to fix remaining test files and compiler passes
   - Remaining: ~40-50 errors

Progress: 478 → 349 type errors (129 fixed, 27% complete)

Next work: Continue fixing Block.inputs/outputs errors in:
- Test files: pass5-scc.test.ts, pass6-block-lowering.test.ts, pass8-link-resolution.test.ts
- Compiler passes: pass1-normalize.ts, pass2-types.ts
- Other files with block.inputs/outputs access
