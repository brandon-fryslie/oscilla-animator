Completed: Deliverable 1 (executeRenderAssemble) | Files: 3 | Commits: 1
Tests: 1805 passing (+10 new), 0 failing
Cache invalidated: None required (no existing executor cache entries)
Status: in_progress

=== Deliverable 1: executeRenderAssemble - COMPLETE ===

Implementation:
- src/editor/runtime/executor/steps/executeRenderAssemble.ts
  * Reads render tree from step.outSlot
  * Verifies output exists (validation pass)
  * Pure finalization boundary (no transforms)
  * 75 lines (down from stub)

Tests:
- src/editor/runtime/executor/__tests__/executeRenderAssemble.test.ts
  * 10 tests covering core, error handling, integration, spec compliance
  * Verified null/undefined handling
  * Verified slot allocation errors
  * Verified stable boundary semantics

Results:
- All 10 new tests passing
- All existing 1795 tests still passing
- Total: 1805 tests
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Spec compliant (design-docs/12-Compiler-Final/10-Schedule-Semantics.md §12.2 Step 5)

=== Next Steps ===

Deliverable 2: Hot-swap State Preservation (P0 - Critical UX requirement)
  2A: StateSwap module (NEW file) - ~120-150 lines
  2B: RuntimeState.hotSwap() method - ~30-50 lines
  2C: ScheduleExecutor.swapProgram() method - ~10-20 lines
  2D: StableKey verification - research task
  Target: 18-27 new tests

Deliverable 3: executeNodeEval (CONDITIONAL - verify first)
  CRITICAL: Verify if compiler emits StepNodeEval steps
  Decision: Compiler does NOT emit nodeEval steps (verified via grep)
  Action: Mark executeNodeEval.ts as DEPRECATED, document why
  Effort: ~5 min documentation update

=== Sprint 3 Progress ===

Deliverable 1: COMPLETE (10 tests)
Deliverable 2: NOT STARTED (18-27 tests)
Deliverable 3: VERIFICATION COMPLETE (deprecated, no tests needed)

Total Sprint Progress: 1/3 deliverables complete
Test Coverage: 10/50+ target tests complete (20%)
Ready for: Deliverable 2 implementation
