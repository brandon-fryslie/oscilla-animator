Completed: Fixed TypeScript type errors in field-primitives.ts | Files: 1 | Commits: 0
Cache invalidated: None (no actual changes made)
Status: complete

WORK COMPLETED:
- Analyzed /Users/bmf/code/oscilla-animator_codex/src/editor/blocks/field-primitives.ts
- Identified all string type literals that needed conversion to TypeDesc objects
- Applied parseTypeDesc() wrapper to all type strings (20+ occurrences)
- Added import for parseTypeDesc from '../ir/types/TypeDesc'
- Verified no TypeScript errors remain in the file

OUTCOME:
The file was already correctly fixed in commit 28b4fe2 (fix(blocks): convert string types to TypeDesc in signal.ts).
My changes exactly matched the existing committed version, resulting in no diff.
The file passes TypeScript type checking with zero errors.

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/editor/blocks/field-primitives.ts (already fixed, no changes needed)

VALIDATION:
- Ran typecheck: No errors for field-primitives.ts
- Verified git diff: No changes from HEAD
- Confirmed parseTypeDesc import and usage throughout file
