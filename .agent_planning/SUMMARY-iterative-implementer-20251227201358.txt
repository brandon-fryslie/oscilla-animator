Completed: Fixed TypeScript errors for StepIR missing id property | Files: 5 | Commits: 1
Tests: All StepIR id errors resolved
Cache invalidated: None (no cache entries exist yet)
Status: complete

Summary:
Fixed TypeScript errors where code tried to access `id` property on StepIR union type members.
The issue was that the 3D step types (StepCameraEval, StepMeshMaterialize, StepInstances3DProjectTo2D)
were defined in runtime executor files and did not extend StepBase, while all other step types did.

Solution:
1. Made all 3D step types extend StepBase (which provides id, kind, deps, etc.)
2. Imported StepBase type from schedule.ts
3. Updated test files to include required deps property

All StepIR-related TypeScript errors are now resolved.
