Scope: module/wp1-timeroot-compilers
Completion: 85% | Gaps: 4 major features missing | Test Quality: HIGH
Reused: time-architecture.md (FRESH) | Fresh: 23 files reviewed
Cache updated: wp1-implementation-status.md in eval-cache/
Ambiguities: 2 found (TimeModel update timing, scrubbing phase offset)
Workflow: PAUSE - "Need clarification on dependency order and spec conflicts"

Critical Finding: WP1 core implementation WORKS (TimeRoot compilers, TimeModel, player integration), but missing spec-defined features (wrap events, bus auto-publication, optional inputs) and both dependency prerequisites (WP0, bus-semantics-module) are PROPOSED with NO work started.

Blocking Issues:
1. Bus auto-publication cannot be safely implemented without WP0 (reserved bus enforcement)
2. Spec conflict: TimeModel update timing (immediate vs. scheduled at pulse boundary)
3. Dependency order violated: WP1 implemented before WP0 completion

Missing Features (HIGH priority):
- CycleTimeRoot missing outputs: wrap (Event), cycleT, cycleIndex
- Bus auto-publication (phase->phaseA, wrap->pulse) not implemented
- Optional inputs (phaseOffset, drift) not implemented

Tech Debt:
- Legacy inference paths still present (PhaseMachine, PhaseClock fallbacks)
- Deprecated player properties (loopMode, playDirection)

Recommendations:
1. Clarify dependency order: Should WP0 be completed first?
2. Resolve TimeModel update timing spec conflict
3. Implement missing outputs + auto-publication (with or without WP0)
4. Visual test TimeConsole UI mode switching
5. Remove legacy code once safe
