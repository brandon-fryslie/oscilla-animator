## Summary

Fixed three TypeScript errors related to missing exports and imports:

1. **BlockRegistry export**: Added `export type BlockRegistry = Record<string, BlockCompiler>` to `src/editor/compiler/types.ts`
2. **PortRef re-export**: Added `PortRef` to the re-export list in `src/editor/compiler/types.ts`
3. **ParamSchema import**: Added `ParamSchema` to the import in `src/editor/blocks/factory.ts` (auto-fixed by linter)
4. **AutoPublication export**: Added `export interface AutoPublication` to `src/editor/compiler/types.ts`
5. **CompilerPatch interface**: Updated to use `Map<BlockId, BlockInstance>` for blocks field (auto-fixed by linter)

## Files Modified
- src/editor/compiler/types.ts (added BlockRegistry, PortRef, AutoPublication, updated CompilerPatch)
- src/editor/blocks/factory.ts (import ParamSchema - auto-fixed)

## Verification
All requested TypeScript errors are now resolved:
- No "has no exported member 'BlockRegistry'" errors
- No "ParamSchema is used but not imported" errors
- No "has no exported member 'AutoPublication'" errors

Other TypeScript errors remain in the codebase but are unrelated to this task.
