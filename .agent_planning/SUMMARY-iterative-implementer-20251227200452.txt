Completed: Fixed paramSchema type issues in block definitions | Files: 2 | Commits: 1
Cache invalidated: None (type-only change, no eval cache impact)
Status: complete

## What was done

Fixed type compilation errors in `src/editor/blocks/__tests__/registry-validation.test.ts` where tests were creating block definitions with a `paramSchema` property that didn't exist on the type definitions.

## Root cause

The `ParamSchema` types were defined at the end of `src/editor/blocks/types.ts` but were not included as a field in `BlockDefinitionBase`. This was legacy code still used by:
- registry-validation tests
- composite-bridge.ts
- composite-utils.ts  
- domain.ts blocks

## Solution

1. **Moved ParamSchema type definitions** to the top of the file (before BlockDefinitionBase)
2. **Added optional paramSchema field** to BlockDefinitionBase with @deprecated tag
3. **Added import** in factory.ts to reference ParamSchema type

## Validation

- Registry validation tests now pass: 16/16 tests passing
- No new type errors introduced in files using paramSchema
- Properly marked as @deprecated to indicate migration path to defaultSource
