Completed: Fixed type errors in 3 files | Files: 3 | Commits: 1
Cache invalidated: None (no cache cleanup needed for type fixes)
Status: complete

Fixed Files:
1. src/editor/replaceUtils.ts (9 errors) - Fixed in previous commit d2911d0
   - Changed import from nonexistent 'Slot' to 'SlotDef'
   - Added BLOCK_REGISTRY import → changed to getBlockDefinition()
   - Added type annotations for slot parameter (s: SlotDef)
   - Fixed Block type usage - Block instances don't have inputs/outputs, use registry

2. src/editor/kernel/PatchKernel.ts (11 errors) - Fixed in commit 00f47f7
   - Created toPatchDocument() adapter function
   - Converts Patch to PatchDocument format for semantic layer
   - Extracts block inputs/outputs from registry definitions
   - Added SlotDef import and proper type annotations

3. src/editor/compiler/blocks/signal/SignalExpression.ts (9 errors) - Fixed in previous commit d2911d0
   - Updated TypeDesc from string to object: { world, domain, category, busEligible, lanes }
   - Changed ValueKind from 'Signal:number' to 'Signal:float'
   - Updated artifact kind checks to use 'Signal:float' and 'Scalar:float'
   - Added support for 'Signal:int' and 'Scalar:int' variants

Root Causes:
- Type system migration: TypeDesc changed from string to structured object
- ValueKind changes: 'number' types split into 'float' and 'int'
- Slot type renamed from 'Slot' to 'SlotDef'
- Block instances don't store inputs/outputs (stored in registry instead)
- PatchDocument interface has different structure than Patch interface

Verification:
- All 29 type errors in target files resolved (verified with grep count = 0)
- Remaining project errors are in other files (not part of this task)
