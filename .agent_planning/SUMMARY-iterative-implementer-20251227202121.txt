Fixed TypeScript error at line 132 in pure-block-validator.test.ts.

Issue: The CanvasRender artifact's value function was returning an object missing the `cmds` property that RenderTree from runtime/renderCmd.ts requires.

Resolution:
- Changed line 137 from: `value: () => ({ kind: "group" as const, id: "root", children: [] })`
- To: `value: () => ({ cmds: [{ kind: "group" as const, children: [] }] })`

The fix correctly implements the RenderTree interface from runtime/renderCmd.ts which requires:
```typescript
interface RenderTree {
  cmds: RenderCmd[];
}
```

No commit made as this is a test file fix only.
