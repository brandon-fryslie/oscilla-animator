Sprint 2 Details:
- 2.1: Migrated ConnectionInspector.tsx to use resolveBinding() facade
- 2.2: Migrated Inspector.tsx PortItem to use getIncomingBindingForInputPort/getOutgoingBindingsForOutputPort
- 2.3: Migrated PatchBay.tsx getConnectionInfo() to use binding facade

Changes:
- ConnectionInspector.tsx: Replaced 164 lines of manual resolution with facade call
- Inspector.tsx: Removed connections prop from PortItem, replaced tri-scan with facade
- PatchBay.tsx: Replaced getConnectionInfo() tri-scan with facade calls
- Fixed pre-existing Unicode quote issue in bus-compilation.test.ts

Key wins:
- Eliminated O(N²) tri-scans in PatchBay port rendering
- Removed ~150 lines of duplicated resolution logic
- All binding resolution now centralized in bindings/ module
- All tests passing (2425), TypeScript clean

Ready for Sprint 3: BusInspector, BusPicker, PublishMenu migration
