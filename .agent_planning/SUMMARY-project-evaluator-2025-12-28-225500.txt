Scope: field-runtime-redflag (P0, P0.5, P1, P2, P3)
Completion: P0+P0.5+P1 COMPLETE (75%) | P2+P3 NOT STARTED (25%)
Test Status: 2430/2455 passing (99.0%)
Reused: STATUS-2025-12-28.md findings (RECENT)
Fresh: Code inspection + test run validation
Ambiguities: 2 found (domain inputs, params model)
Workflow: PAUSE (need user decisions before proceeding)

Key Findings:
- P0 (Hard error on signal fallback): ✅ COMPLETE - evalSig() throws with clear message
- P0.5 (No silent default fallback): ✅ COMPLETE - compiler throws on missing inputs
- P1 (Params propagation): ✅ COMPLETE - params flow from IR nodes to FieldHandle (uncommitted)
- P2 (Remove legacy params): ❌ NOT STARTED - implementation strategy changed, may not be needed
- P3 (Update audit doc): ❌ NOT STARTED - waiting on strategy decision

Test Failures:
- 12 failures across 3 test files
- All same root cause: 7 blocks missing defaultSource declarations
- NOT a runtime bug - expected behavior under new strict compilation
- Blocks: CycleTimeRoot, GridDomain, DomainN, RenderInstances2D, FieldConstNumber, PositionMapGrid, PositionMapCircle

Uncommitted Changes (correct, ready to commit):
- src/editor/runtime/field/FieldHandle.ts - params propagation
- src/editor/runtime/field/types.ts - params in IR types

Decisions Needed:
1. Domain inputs - defaultSource, must-wire, or fix tests?
2. Params - official (compiler-populated) or deprecated (remove)?

Next: Wait for user clarification, then either commit or revise.
