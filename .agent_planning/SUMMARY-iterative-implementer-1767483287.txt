TASK: Add missing type exports to src/editor/types.ts

FINDINGS:
The types were already added in previous commits:
- Commit 3e3b612: Added types to blocks/types.ts
- Commit 3a34cee: Added types to main types.ts

WORK COMPLETED:
1. Verified all "has no exported member" errors were resolved
2. Fixed BusCombineMode → CombineMode rename in modulation-table/types.ts
3. Confirmed blocks/types.ts properly re-exports all needed types

TYPES SUCCESSFULLY EXPORTED:
✓ Slot, SlotWorld, SlotTier - slot system types
✓ BlockSubcategory, BlockCategory, ALL_SUBCATEGORIES - block organization
✓ KernelId, KernelCapability, Capability, PureCompileKind - kernel/compile types
✓ DefaultSource - default value types
✓ CombinePolicy (deprecated alias for CombineMode)
✓ SLOT_TYPE_TO_TYPE_DESC - backward compat stub
✓ createTypeDesc, isDirectlyCompatible - re-exported functions
✓ ExposedParam - composite parameter type
✓ TypeWorld, Domain - re-exported from submodules
✓ SlotType - re-exported in blocks/types.ts

INTENTIONALLY NOT ADDED (per instructions):
- Publisher, Listener - removed in bus-block unification

REMAINING WORK (separate from this task):
- UIControlHint type needs update (currently string literals, but code uses objects with 'kind' field)
- Files importing Publisher/Listener need migration to Edge-based architecture
- Some compiler passes have type errors unrelated to missing exports

VALIDATION:
Before: 30+ "has no exported member" errors
After: 0 "has no exported member" errors
