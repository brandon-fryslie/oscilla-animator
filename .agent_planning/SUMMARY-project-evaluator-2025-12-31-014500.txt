Scope: module/type-contracts-ir-plumbing
Completion: 40% | Gaps: 3 critical | Test Quality: N/A (tests broken)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: all findings
Cache updated: [2 files] type-contracts-divergence.md, adapter-application-status.md
Ambiguities: 3 found | Workflow: PAUSE (3 questions need answers first)

CRITICAL FINDING: Type system divergence WORSE than plan describes.
- Editor TypeDesc and IR TypeDesc are structurally incompatible
- Different worlds: 'config' vs 'special'
- Different fields: editor has category/busEligible, IR has bundleKind/bundleArity
- Different domain enums: 90+ vs 30, partial overlap
- Silent bugs: defaultSource materialization broken for 'config' types

BLOCKING ISSUES:
1. TypeDesc unification impossible without architectural decision
2. 'config' vs 'special' world mismatch breaks defaultSource
3. Adapter application timing unclear (Plan says Pass 6, code has Pass 8)

DELIVERABLE STATUS:
1. Unify TypeDesc: NOT STARTED (blocked by architectural decision)
2. Adapter/lens in Pass 6: PARTIAL (only in Pass 8, missing from Pass 6)
3. DefaultSource consistency: PARTIAL (works for numeric, broken for 'config')
4. Pass 8 hardening: COMPLETE (strong error handling exists)

NEXT ACTION REQUIRED: User must answer 3 architectural questions before work can proceed.
