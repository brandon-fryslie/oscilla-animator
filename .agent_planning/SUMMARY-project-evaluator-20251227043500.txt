Scope: project/undo-redo-phase2
Completion: Foundation 100%, Migration 15% | Gaps: 12 methods not migrated | Test Quality: 4/5
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: all findings (new evaluation scope)
Cache updated: N/A (topic-specific evaluation)
Ambiguities: 4 found | Workflow: CONTINUE

Key Findings:
- Sprint 1 delivered complete foundation: ops, TxBuilder, HistoryStore, UI (66 tests)
- Critical gap: PatchStore methods (addBlock, removeBlock, updateBlockParams) bypass runTx()
- User cannot undo most operations because stores use direct mutations
- BusStore partially migrated (~50%): createBus, addPublisher, addListener use runTx()
- Block position undo not implemented (applySetBlockPosition is no-op)

Priority for Phase 2:
1. Migrate addBlock() - most common operation
2. Migrate removeBlock() - should use removeBlockCascade
3. Migrate updateBlockParams() - every param slider
4. Complete BusStore migration (deleteBus, updateBus, update methods)
5. Add integration tests for undo flow

-> Next: Implementer should migrate PatchStore.addBlock() to use runTx()
