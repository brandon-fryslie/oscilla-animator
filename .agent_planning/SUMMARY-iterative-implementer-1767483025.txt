Status: complete

Summary:
Fixed 14 TypeScript errors in src/editor/blocks/types.ts by defining missing types that were being imported from '../types' but did not exist there.

Defined types:
- KernelCapability: 'time' | 'identity' | 'state' | 'render' | 'io'
- KernelId: keyof typeof KERNEL_PRIMITIVES
- PureCompileKind: 'operator' | 'composite' | 'spec'
- Capability: KernelCapability | 'pure'
- BlockSubcategory: 'Sources' | 'Fields' | 'Timing' | ... | 'Other'
- SlotWorld: 'signal' | 'field' | 'scalar' | 'config'
- SlotTier: 'compile' | 'frame' | 'element'
- Slot: alias for SlotDef
- DefaultSource: deprecated type for backward compat

Updated imports in factory.ts and kernel-primitives.ts to import from './types'.

Verification:
- just typecheck shows 0 errors in blocks/types.ts, factory.ts, kernel-primitives.ts
- All 14 original errors resolved
- Commit: 3e3b612

Next: There are 901 total TypeScript errors remaining in the codebase (unrelated to this fix)
