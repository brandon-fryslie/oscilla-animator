# Unified Bindings Implementation Progress
Updated: 2025-12-30 02:10

## Overall Status
Sprint 1: COMPLETE (100%)
Sprint 2: NOT STARTED (0%)
Sprint 3: NOT STARTED (0%)
Sprint 4: NOT STARTED (0%)

## Sprint 1: Binding Facade Foundation ✓ COMPLETE

### Deliverables Completed
- [x] File `src/editor/bindings/types.ts` exists with all required types
- [x] File `src/editor/bindings/read.ts` exists with read-side facade
- [x] File `src/editor/bindings/write.ts` exists with write-side facade
- [x] File `src/editor/bindings/index.ts` exists and re-exports all public APIs
- [x] `BusStore.updateListener()` signature expanded to accept `adapterChain`
- [x] TypeScript compiles clean (no new errors)
- [x] Existing tests still pass (1063 tests)
- [x] Sanity check: Facade can be imported without crash

### Technical Notes
- Normalization rules working correctly (enabled defaults to true for wires, [] for lens/adapter stacks)
- Type resolution uses SLOT_TYPE_TO_TYPE_DESC for ports, bus.type for buses
- resolveBinding() handles all three kinds with proper error reporting
- Input writer invariant enforced by getIncomingBindingForInputPort (returns at most one binding)

### Validation Results
- TypeScript: ✓ CLEAN
- Tests: ✓ 1063/1063 PASSING
- Imports: ✓ No runtime errors

## Sprint 2: High-Value UI Migration - NOT STARTED

### Planned Work
1. Migrate ConnectionInspector.tsx (lines 703-867 resolution logic)
2. Migrate Inspector.tsx port panel queries
3. Migrate PatchBay.tsx getConnectionInfo()

### Blocked By
None - ready to start

## Sprint 3: Complete UI Migration - NOT STARTED

### Planned Work
1. Migrate BusInspector.tsx
2. Migrate BusPicker.tsx  
3. Migrate PublishMenu.tsx

### Blocked By
Sprint 2 completion

## Sprint 4: Validation Layer (Optional) - NOT STARTED

### Planned Work
1. Add Validator.canAddPublisher()
2. Add Validator.canAddListener()
3. Unit tests for validation

### Blocked By
Sprint 2 completion (can run in parallel with Sprint 3)

## Commit History
- f5e2445 feat(bindings): Add unified bindings facade (Sprint 1)

## Next Session Tasks
1. Start Sprint 2: Migrate ConnectionInspector
2. Replace manual resolution (lines 703-867) with resolveBinding()
3. Keep existing view components unchanged
4. Run manual tests in `just dev`
