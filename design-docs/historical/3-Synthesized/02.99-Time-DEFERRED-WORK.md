### 4.3 Bus Binding & Publication Policy

Each Cycle Overlay lane has explicit bus publication controls.

For each output (phase, pulse, cycleIndex, energy, palette), the Time Console MUST show:
- Target bus
- Enabled/disabled toggle
- Conflict indicator if user publishers exist

When user publishers target a reserved bus, the Time Console MUST expose a precedence selector for that bus:

- Overlay only
- User only
- Mixed

Changing this policy immediately enables/disables overlay publishers for that bus.

No implicit overrides are permitted.

## 5. PatchTimeOverlay Data Model

Add to Patch:

```
timeOverlay: {
  cycles: {
    A: CycleSpec,
    B: CycleSpec,
    energy: EnergySpec,
    palette: PaletteSpec
  }
}
```

## 7. Debugging & Transparency

The system MUST support:

- **Reveal in Graph** — show generated operators as read-only nodes
- **Convert to Blocks** — materialize overlay cycles onto canvas
- **Provenance** — bus values show source `TimeOverlay.CycleA.phase`
