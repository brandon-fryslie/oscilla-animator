## **6) Detailed UX: how phase, looping, and infinity** 

## **feel**

##  **to use**

  

This section describes the **moment-to-moment user experience** of working with phase, loops, and infinite animation.

Not widgets yet — this is about _interaction, intuition, and play_.

# **A. The core UX promise**

  

From the user’s point of view:

  

> “Nothing ever ‘ends’.

> Things pulse, drift, return, and evolve — and I can _lean into_ any of those behaviors.”

  

The UX must make infinite time feel:

- safe
    
- musical
    
- exploratory
    
- never brittle
    

---

# **B. How users** 

# **discover**

#  **looping (without being told)**

  

There is **no “Loop” button** that turns looping on.

  

Instead:

- users add a **phase source**
    
- publish it to a bus
    
- bind visual attributes to it
    
- observe repetition
    

  

Looping is **emergent**, not declared.

  

This mirrors music:

- there is no “enable groove”
    
- you add rhythm, and groove appears
    

---

# **C. The primary mental model users operate in**

  

Users think in terms of:

- **“What is the rhythm here?”**
    
    → phase buses
    
- **“What responds to that rhythm?”**
    
    → bindings + interpretation stacks
    
- **“What evolves over time?”**
    
    → slow buses, integrators, regime switches
    

  

They do _not_ think in:

- frames
    
- keyframes
    
- start/end points
    
- duration sliders (except when defining phase periods)
    

---

# **D. UX around phase sources**

  

### **Adding a phase source feels like:**

  

> “I’m adding a clock.”

  

When a phase block is placed:

- its period is immediately visible
    
- its waveform/shape is previewed
    
- it offers one-click publishing to a new or existing phase bus
    

  

There is no ambiguity about:

- what repeats
    
- how fast
    
- how it lines up with other phases
    

---

# **E. Binding to phase: clarity over cleverness**

  

When a user binds a parameter to a phase bus:

1. The parameter moves _immediately_
    
2. The movement is usually boring at first (identity mapping)
    
3. A subtle affordance appears:
    
    “Change how this feels”
    

  

The system invites _interpretation_, not configuration.

---

# **F. Interpretation stacks as “performance feel”**

  

Interpretation stacks are presented as:

- _feel-shaping tools_
    
- not technical adapters
    

  

Examples users recognize immediately:

- “ease in”
    
- “step through”
    
- “only sometimes”
    
- “slow it down”
    
- “react only at peaks”
    

  

This makes looping expressive instead of mechanical.

---

# **G. Multi-scale time: how users** 

# **sense**

#  **it**

  

Users don’t think “micro/meso/macro”.

  

They think:

- “this wiggles”
    
- “this drifts”
    
- “this changes mood every so often”
    

  

The UX reinforces this by:

- visually grouping buses by tempo
    
- showing slow buses with longer sparklines
    
- subtly color-coding time scales
    

  

This teaches rhythm by sight.

---

# **H. Infinite time without anxiety**

  

A critical UX goal:

  

> Users must never feel like they are “missing something” because time is passing.

  

Therefore:

- scrubbing always works for derived phase systems
    
- stateful systems show clear indicators
    
- users can pause, inspect, rewind _without penalty_
    

  

Time is something you explore, not chase.

---

# **I. Live editing as play, not surgery**

  

While the system runs:

- users add blocks
    
- change bindings
    
- re-route influence
    
- adjust phase relationships
    

  

Nothing “breaks”.

Nothing hard-resets unless explicitly requested.

  

This makes:

- exploration joyful
    
- complexity approachable
    
- mistakes harmless
    

---

# **J. Performance mode: the system becomes an instrument**

  

In Performance Mode:

- phase buses feel like tempo faders
    
- energy feels like dynamics
    
- palette feels like harmony
    
- triggers feel like hits
    

  

The UX shifts from “editing” to “playing”:

- larger controls
    
- fewer distractions
    
- emphasis on buses over blocks
    

  

This is where infinite animation becomes _alive_.

---

# **K. Why this UX feels like a music visualizer**

  

Because:

- time is shared
    
- structure is rhythmic
    
- interpretation varies per consumer
    
- change is continuous, not discrete
    

  

The visuals are not _following_ time — they are _inhabiting_ it.
